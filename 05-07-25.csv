A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28 would be 1+2+4+7+14=28, which means that 28 is a perfect number.
A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than n and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n.
As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1+2+3+4+6=16, the smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is 24. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However, this upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis even though it is known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit.

54,Poker Hands,Problem 54,"
In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards and are ranked, from lowest to highest, in the following way:
High Card: Highest value card.
One Pair: Two cards of the same value.
Two Pairs: Two different pairs.
Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same value.
Straight: All cards are consecutive values.
Flush: All cards of the same suit.
Full House: Three of a kind and a pair.
Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same value.
Straight Flush: All cards are consecutive values of same suit.
Royal Flush: Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit.
The cards are valued in the order:2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.
If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the highest value wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives (see example 1 below). But if two ranks tie, for example, both players have a pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand are compared (see example 4 below); if the highest cards tie then the next highest cards are compared, and so on.

Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,
349+943=12921292+2921=42134213+3124=7337
That is, 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.
Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, like 196, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel number. Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number is Lychrel until proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every number below ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all the computing power that exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In fact, 10677 is the first number to be shown to require over fifty iterations before producing a palindrome: 4668731596684224866951378664 (53 iterations, 28-digits).

59,XOR Decryption,Problem 59,"
Each character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the preferred standard is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). For example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and lowercase k = 107.
A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes to ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret key. The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key on the cipher text, restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42 = 107, then 107 XOR 42 = 65.
For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and without both ""halves"", it is impossible to decrypt the message.
Unfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than the message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout the message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long password key for security, but short enough to be memorable.
Your task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three lower case characters. Using 0059_cipher.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a file containing the encrypted ASCII codes, and the knowledge that the plain text must contain common English words, decrypt the message and find the sum of the ASCII values in the original text.

All square roots are periodic when written as continued fractions and can be written in the form:
N=a0+1a1+1a2+1a3+…
For example, let us consider 23:
23=4+23−4=4+1123−4=4+11+23−37
If we continue we would get the following expansion:

a0=4,123−4=23+47=1+23−37
a1=1,723−3=7(23+3)14=3+23−32
a2=3,223−3=2(23+3)14=1+23−47

For example, as 1,2,4,5,7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, ϕ(9)=6.The number 1 is considered to be relatively prime to every positive number, so ϕ(1)=1. 
Interestingly, ϕ(87109)=79180, and it can be seen that 87109 is a permutation of 79180.
Find the value of n, 1<n<107, for which ϕ(n) is a permutation of n and the ratio n/ϕ(n) produces a minimum.

90,Cube Digit Pairs,Problem 90,"
Each of the six faces on a cube has a different digit (0 to 9) written on it; the same is done to a second cube. By placing the two cubes side-by-side in different positions we can form a variety of 2-digit numbers.
For example, the square number 64 could be formed:


In fact, by carefully choosing the digits on both cubes it is possible to display all of the square numbers below one-hundred: 01, 04, 09, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and 81.
For example, one way this can be achieved is by placing {0,5,6,7,8,9} on one cube and {1,2,3,4,8,9} on the other cube.
However, for this problem we shall allow the 6 or 9 to be turned upside-down so that an arrangement like {0,5,6,7,8,9} and {1,2,3,4,6,7} allows for all nine square numbers to be displayed; otherwise it would be impossible to obtain 09.
In determining a distinct arrangement we are interested in the digits on each cube, not the order.
{1,2,3,4,5,6} is equivalent to {3,6,4,1,2,5}
{1,2,3,4,5,6} is distinct from {1,2,3,4,5,9}
But because we are allowing 6 and 9 to be reversed, the two distinct sets in the last example both represent the extended set {1,2,3,4,5,6,9} for the purpose of forming 2-digit numbers.

The proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14. As the sum of these divisors is equal to 28, we call it a perfect number.

If we are presented with the first k terms of a sequence it is impossible to say with certainty the value of the next term, as there are infinitely many polynomial functions that can model the sequence.
As an example, let us consider the sequence of cube numbers. This is defined by the generating function,un=n3: 1,8,27,64,125,216,…
Suppose we were only given the first two terms of this sequence. Working on the principle that ""simple is best"" we should assume a linear relationship and predict the next term to be 15 (common difference 7). Even if we were presented with the first three terms, by the same principle of simplicity, a quadratic relationship should be assumed.
We shall define OP(k,n) to be the nth term of the optimum polynomial generating function for the first k terms of a sequence. It should be clear that OP(k,n) will accurately generate the terms of the sequence for n≤k, and potentially the first incorrect term (FIT) will be OP(k,k+1); in which case we shall call it a bad OP (BOP).
As a basis, if we were only given the first term of sequence, it would be most sensible to assume constancy; that is, for n≥2, OP(1,n)=u1.
Hence we obtain the following OPs for the cubic sequence:

OP(1,n)=1

It turns out that F541, which contains 113 digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital (contain all the digits 1 to 9, but not necessarily in order). And F2749, which contains 575 digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits are 1-9 pandigital.
Given that Fk is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits AND the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital, find k.

109,Darts,Problem 109,"
In the game of darts a player throws three darts at a target board which is split into twenty equal sized sections numbered one to twenty.


The score of a dart is determined by the number of the region that the dart lands in. A dart landing outside the red/green outer ring scores zero. The black and cream regions inside this ring represent single scores. However, the red/green outer ring and middle ring score double and treble scores respectively.
At the centre of the board are two concentric circles called the bull region, or bulls-eye. The outer bull is worth 25 points and the inner bull is a double, worth 50 points.
There are many variations of rules but in the most popular game the players will begin with a score 301 or 501 and the first player to reduce their running total to zero is a winner. However, it is normal to play a ""doubles out"" system, which means that the player must land a double (including the double bulls-eye at the centre of the board) on their final dart to win; any other dart that would reduce their running total to one or lower means the score for that set of three darts is ""bust"".
When a player is able to finish  on their current score it is called a ""checkout"" and the highest checkout is 170: T20 T20 D25 (two treble 20s and double bull).
There are exactly eleven distinct ways to checkout on a score of 6:

Note that D1 D2 is considered different to D2 D1 as they finish on different doubles. However, the combination S1 T1 D1 is considered the same as T1 S1 D1.
In addition we shall not include misses in considering combinations; for example, D3 is the same as 0 D3 and 0 0 D3.
Incredibly there are 42336 distinct ways of checking out in total.

1117,1151,1171,1181,1511,1811,2111,4111,8111.
We shall say that M(n,d) represents the maximum number of repeated digits for an n-digit prime where d is the repeated digit, N(n,d) represents the number of such primes, and S(n,d) represents the sum of these primes.
So M(4,1)=3 is the maximum number of repeated digits for a 4-digit prime where one is the repeated digit, there are N(4,1)=9 such primes, and the sum of these primes is S(4,1)=22275. It turns out that for d=0, it is only possible to have M(4,0)=2 repeated digits, but there are N(4,0)=13 such cases.

The specific white cell we will be considering is an ellipse with the equation 4x2+y2=100.
The section corresponding to −0.01≤x≤+0.01 at the top is missing, allowing the light to enter and exit through the hole.

The light beam in this problem starts at the point (0.0,10.1) just outside the white cell, and the beam first impacts the mirror at (1.4,−9.6).
Each time the laser beam hits the surface of the ellipse, it follows the usual law of reflection ""angle of incidence equals angle of reflection."" That is, both the incident and reflected beams make the same angle with the normal line at the point of incidence.
In the figure on the left, the red line shows the first two points of contact between the laser beam and the wall of the white cell; the blue line shows the line tangent to the ellipse at the point of incidence of the first bounce.
The slope m of the tangent line at any point (x,y) of the given ellipse is: m=−4x/y.The normal line is perpendicular to this tangent line at the point of incidence.

150,Sub-triangle Sums,Problem 150,"
In a triangular array of positive and negative integers, we wish to find a sub-triangle such that the sum of the numbers it contains is the smallest possible.
In the example below, it can be easily verified that the marked triangle satisfies this condition having a sum of −42.


We wish to make such a triangular array with one thousand rows, so we generate 500500 pseudo-random numbers sk in the range ±219, using a type of random number generator (known as a Linear Congruential Generator) as follows:
t := 0

for k = 1 up to k = 500500:

    t := (615949*t + 797807) modulo 220
    sk := t−219
Thus: s1 = 273519, s2 = −153582, s3 = 450905 etc
Our triangular array is then formed using the pseudo-random numbers thus:

s1
s2  s3
s4  s5  s6  

s7  s8  s9  s10
...

Sub-triangles can start at any element of the array and extend down as far as we like (taking-in the two elements directly below it from the next row, the three elements directly below from the row after that, and so on).

The ""sum of a sub-triangle"" is defined as the sum of all the elements it contains.

A printing shop runs 16 batches (jobs) every week and each batch requires a sheet of special colour-proofing paper of size A5.
Every Monday morning, the supervisor opens a new envelope, containing a large sheet of the special paper with size A1.
The supervisor proceeds to cut it in half, thus getting two sheets of size A2. Then one of the sheets is cut in half to get two sheets of size A3 and so on until an A5-size sheet is obtained, which is needed for the first batch of the week.
All the unused sheets are placed back in the envelope.

At the beginning of each subsequent batch, the supervisor takes from the envelope one sheet of paper at random. If it is of size A5, then it is used. If it is larger, then the 'cut-in-half' procedure is repeated until an A5-size sheet is obtained, and any remaining sheets are always placed back in the envelope.
Excluding the first and last batch of the week, find the expected number of times (during each week) that the supervisor finds a single sheet of paper in the envelope.
Give your answer rounded to six decimal places using the format x.xxxxxx .

153,Investigating Gaussian Integers,Problem 153,"
As we all know the equation x2=−1 has no solutions for real x.

If we however introduce the imaginary number i this equation has two solutions: x=i and x=−i.

If we go a step further the equation (x−3)2=−4 has two complex solutions: x=3+2i and x=3−2i.
x=3+2i and x=3−2i are called each others' complex conjugate.

Numbers of the form a+bi are called complex numbers.

In general a+bi and a−bi are each other's complex conjugate.
A Gaussian Integer is a complex number a+bi such that both a and b are integers.

The regular integers are also Gaussian integers (with b=0).

To distinguish them from Gaussian integers with b≠0 we call such integers ""rational integers.""

A Gaussian integer a+bi is called a divisor of a rational integer n if the result na+bi is also a Gaussian integer.

If for example we divide 5 by 1+2i we can simplify 51+2i in the following manner:

Multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of 1+2i: 1−2i.

The result is 51+2i=51+2i1−2i1−2i=5(1−2i)1−(2i)2=5(1−2i)1−(−4)=5(1−2i)5=1−2i.

So 1+2i is a divisor of 5.

Note that 1+i is not a divisor of 5 because 51+i=52−52i.

Note also that if the Gaussian Integer (a+bi) is a divisor of a rational integer n, then its complex conjugate (a−bi) is also a divisor of n.
In fact, 5 has six divisors such that the real part is positive: {1,1+2i,1−2i,2+i,2−i,5}.

The following is a table of all of the divisors for the first five positive rational integers:

<br>
If for example we divide $5$ by $1+2i$ we can simplify $\dfrac{5}{1 + 2i}$ in the following manner:
<br>
Multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of $1+2i$: $1-2i$.
<br>
The result is $\dfrac{5}{1 + 2i} = \dfrac{5}{1 + 2i}\dfrac{1 - 2i}{1 - 2i} = \dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{1 - (2i)^2} = \dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{1 - (-4)} = \dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{5} = 1 - 2i$.
<br>
So $1+2i$ is a divisor of $5$.
<br>
Note that $1+i$ is not a divisor of $5$ because $\dfrac{5}{1 + i} = \dfrac{5}{2} - \dfrac{5}{2}i$.

Using this simple procedure and up to n identical capacitors, we can make circuits having a range of different total capacitances. For example, using up to n=3 capacitors of 60 μF each, we can obtain the following 7 distinct total capacitance values: 

If we denote by D(n) the number of distinct total capacitance values we can obtain when using up to n equal-valued capacitors and the simple procedure described above, we have: D(1)=1, D(2)=3, D(3)=7, …

Starting from zero the natural numbers are written down in base 10 like this:

Consider the digit d=1. After we write down each number n, we will update the number of ones that have occurred and call this number f(n,1). The first values for f(n,1), then, are as follows:
nf(n,1)00112131415161718191102114125
Note that f(n,1) never equals 3.

So the first two solutions of the equation f(n,1)=n are n=0 and n=1. The next solution is n=199981.

165,Intersections,Problem 165,"
A segment is uniquely defined by its two endpoints. By considering two line segments in plane geometry there are three possibilities: 
the segments have zero points, one point, or infinitely many points in common.
Moreover when two segments have exactly one point in common it might be the case that that common point is an endpoint of either one of the segments or of both. If a common point of two segments is not an endpoint of either of the segments it is an interior point of both segments.
We will call a common point T of two segments L1 and L2 a true intersection point of L1 and L2 if T is the only common point of L1 and L2 and T is an interior point of both segments.

Consider the three segments L1, L2, and L3:

L1: (27,44) to (12,32)
L2: (46,53) to (17,62)
L3: (46,70) to (22,40)
It can be verified that line segments L2 and L3 have a true intersection point. We note that as the one of the end points of L3: (22,40) lies on L1 this is not considered to be a true point of intersection. L1 and L2 have no common point. So among the three line segments, we find one true intersection point.
Now let us do the same for 5000 line segments. To this end, we generate 20000 numbers using the so-called ""Blum Blum Shub"" pseudo-random number generator.
s0=290797sn+1=sn×sn(mod50515093)tn=sn(mod500)
To create each line segment, we use four consecutive numbers tn. That is, the first line segment is given by:
(t1,t2) to (t3,t4).
The first four numbers computed according to the above generator should be: 27, 144, 12 and 232. The first segment would thus be (27,144) to (12,232).

The RSA encryption is based on the following procedure:
Generate two distinct primes p and q.Compute n=pq and ϕ=(p−1)(q−1).
Find an integer e, 1<e<ϕ, such that gcd(e,ϕ)=1.
A message in this system is a number in the interval [0,n−1].
A text to be encrypted is then somehow converted to messages (numbers in the interval [0,n−1]).
To encrypt the text, for each message, m, c=memodn is calculated.
To decrypt the text, the following procedure is needed: calculate d such that ed=1modϕ, then for each encrypted message, c, calculate m=cdmodn.
There exist values of e and m such that memodn=m.We call messages m for which memodn=m unconcealed messages.
An issue when choosing e is that there should not be too many unconcealed messages.For instance, let p=19 and q=37.
Then n=19⋅37=703 and ϕ=18⋅36=648.
If we choose e=181, then, although gcd(181,648)=1 it turns out that all possible messages m (0≤m≤n−1) are unconcealed when calculating memodn.
For any valid choice of e there exist some unconcealed messages.
It's important that the number of unconcealed messages is at a minimum.
Choose p=1009 and q=3643.

199,Iterative Circle Packing,Problem 199,"
Three circles of equal radius are placed inside a larger circle such that each pair of circles is tangent to one another and the inner circles do not overlap. There are four uncovered ""gaps"" which are to be filled iteratively with more tangent circles.



At each iteration, a maximally sized circle is placed in each gap, which creates more gaps for the next iteration. After 3 iterations (pictured), there are 108 gaps and the fraction of the area which is not covered by circles is 0.06790342, rounded to eight decimal places.

For any two strings of digits, A and B, we define FA,B to be the sequence (A,B,AB,BAB,ABBAB,…) in which each term is the concatenation of the previous two.
Further, we define DA,B(n) to be the nth digit in the first term of FA,B that contains at least n digits.
Example:
Let A=1415926535, B=8979323846. We wish to find DA,B(35), say.
The first few terms of FA,B are:

14159265358979323846897932384614159265358979323846
Then DA,B(35) is the 35th digit in the fifth term, which is 9.
Now we use for A the first 100 digits of π behind the decimal point:

Then, w=14025256741014958470038053646⋯
For a positive integer k, if no substring of w exists with a sum of digits equal to k, p(k) is defined to be zero. If at least one substring of w exists with a sum of digits equal to k, we define p(k)=z, where z is the starting position of the earliest such substring.
For instance:
The substrings 1,14,1402,…

Every night, the child's father has to pick up the pieces of the caterpillar that have been scattered across the play room. He picks up the pieces at random and places them in the correct order. As the caterpillar is built up in this way, it forms distinct segments that gradually merge together. The number of segments starts at zero (no pieces placed), generally increases up to about eleven or twelve, then tends to drop again before finishing at a single segment (all pieces placed).
For example:

Piece Placed

255,Rounded Square Roots,Problem 255,"
We define the rounded-square-root of a positive integer n as the square root of n rounded to the nearest integer.
The following procedure (essentially Heron's method adapted to integer arithmetic) finds the rounded-square-root of n:
Let d be the number of digits of the number n.
If d is odd, set x0=2×10(d−1)/2.
If d is even, set x0=7×10(d−2)/2.
Repeat:
xk+1=⌊xk+⌈n/xk⌉2⌋
until xk+1=xk.
As an example, let us find the rounded-square-root of n=4321.n has 4 digits, so x0=7×10(4−2)/2=70.
x1=⌊70+⌈4321/70⌉2⌋=66
x2=⌊66+⌈4321/66⌉2⌋=66

Since x2=x1, we stop here.
So, after just two iterations, we have found that the rounded-square-root of 4321 is 66 (the actual square root is 65.7343137⋯).

The number of iterations required when using this method is surprisingly low.
For example, we can find the rounded-square-root of a 5-digit integer (10000≤n≤99999) with an average of 3.2102888889 iterations (the average value was rounded to 10 decimal places).

256,Tatami-Free Rooms,Problem 256,"
Tatami are rectangular mats, used to completely cover the floor of a room, without overlap.
Assuming that the only type of available tatami has dimensions 1×2, there are obviously some limitations for the shape and size of the rooms that can be covered.
For this problem, we consider only rectangular rooms with integer dimensions a,b and even size s=a⋅b.
We use the term 'size' to denote the floor surface area of the room, and — without loss of generality — we add the condition a≤b.
There is one rule to follow when laying out tatami: there must be no points where corners of four different mats meet.
For example, consider the two arrangements below for a 4×4 room:


The arrangement on the left is acceptable, whereas the one on the right is not: a red ""X"" in the middle, marks the point where four tatami meet.
Because of this rule, certain even-sized rooms cannot be covered with tatami: we call them tatami-free rooms.
Further, we define T(s) as the number of tatami-free rooms of size s.
The smallest tatami-free room has size s=70 and dimensions 7×10.
All the other rooms of size s=70 can be covered with tatami; they are: 1×70, 2×35 and 5×14.
Hence, T(70)=1.
Similarly, we can verify that T(1320)=5 because there are exactly 5 tatami-free rooms of size s=1320:
20×66, 22×60, 24×55, 30×44 and 33×40.
In fact, s=1320 is the smallest room-size s for which T(s)=5.
Find the smallest room-size s for which T(s)=200.

260,Stone Game,Problem 260,"
A game is played with three piles of stones and two players.
On each player's turn, the player may remove one or more stones from the piles. However, if the player takes stones from more than one pile, then the same number of stones must be removed from each of the selected piles.
In other words, the player chooses some N>0 and removes:
N stones from any single pile; or
N stones from each of any two piles (2N total); or
N stones from each of the three piles (3N total).
The player taking the last stone(s) wins the game.
A winning configuration is one where the first player can force a win.
For example, (0,0,13), (0,11,11), and (5,5,5) are winning configurations because the first player can immediately remove all stones.
A losing configuration is one where the second player can force a win, no matter what the first player does.
For example, (0,1,2) and (1,3,3) are losing configurations: any legal move leaves a winning configuration for the second player.
Consider all losing configurations (xi,yi,zi) where xi≤yi≤zi≤100.

274,Divisibility Multipliers,Problem 274,"
For each integer p>1 coprime to 10 there is a positive divisibility multiplier m<p which preserves divisibility by p for the following function on any positive integer, n:
f(n)=(all but the last digit of n)+(the last digit of n)⋅m.
That is, if m is the divisibility multiplier for p, then f(n) is divisible by p if and only if n is divisible by p.
(When n is much larger than p, f(n) will be less than n and repeated application of f provides a multiplicative divisibility test for p.)
For example, the divisibility multiplier for 113 is 34.
f(76275)=7627+5⋅34=7797: 76275 and 7797 are both divisible by 113.f(12345)=1234+5⋅34=1404: 12345 and 1404 are both not divisible by 113.

When one encounters these strings in nature, they are always folded in such a way that the number of H-H contact points is as large as possible, since this is energetically advantageous.
As a result, the H-elements tend to accumulate in the inner part, with the P-elements on the outside.
Natural proteins are folded in three dimensions of course, but we will only consider protein folding in two dimensions.
The figure below shows two possible ways that our example protein could be folded (H-H contact points are shown with red dots).

The folding on the left has only six H-H contact points, thus it would never occur naturally.
On the other hand, the folding on the right has nine H-H contact points, which is optimal for this string.
Assuming that H and P elements are equally likely to occur in any position along the string, the average number of H-H contact points in an optimal folding of a random protein string of length 8 turns out to be 850/28=3.3203125.
What is the average number of H-H contact points in an optimal folding of a random protein string of length 15?

301,Nim,Problem 301,"
Nim is a game played with heaps of stones, where two players take it in turn to remove any number of stones from any heap until no stones remain.
We'll consider the three-heap normal-play version of Nim, which works as follows:
At the start of the game there are three heaps of stones.
On each player's turn, the player may remove any positive number of stones from any single heap.
The first player unable to move (because no stones remain) loses.
If (n1,n2,n3) indicates a Nim position consisting of heaps of size n1, n2, and n3, then there is a simple function, which you may look up or attempt to deduce for yourself, X(n1,n2,n3) that returns:
zero if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will eventually lose; or
non-zero if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will eventually win.
For example X(1,2,3)=0 because, no matter what the current player does, the opponent can respond with a move that leaves two heaps of equal size, at which point every move by the current player can be mirrored by the opponent until no stones remain; so the current player loses. To illustrate:
current player moves to (1,2,1)
opponent moves to (1,0,1)
current player moves to (0,0,1)
opponent moves to (0,0,0), and so wins.

313,Sliding Game,Problem 313,"
In a sliding game a counter may slide horizontally or vertically into an empty space. The objective of the game is to move the red counter from the top left corner of a grid to the bottom right corner; the space always starts in the bottom right corner. For example, the following sequence of pictures show how the game can be completed in five moves on a 2 by 2 grid.

Let S(m,n) represent the minimum number of moves to complete the game on an m by n grid. For example, it can be verified that S(5,4)=25.

There are exactly 5482 grids for which S(m,n)=p2, where p<100 is prime.
How many grids does S(m,n)=p2, where p<106 is prime?

314,The Mouse on the Moon,Problem 314,"

The moon has been opened up, and land can be obtained for free, but there is a catch. You have to build a wall around the land that you stake out, and building a wall on the moon is expensive. Every country has been allotted a 500 m by 500 m square area, but they will possess only that area which they wall in. 251001 posts have been placed in a rectangular grid with 1 meter spacing. The wall must be a closed series of straight lines, each line running from post to post.


The bigger countries of course have built a 2000 m wall enclosing the entire 250 000m2 area. The Duchy of Grand Fenwick, has a tighter budget, and has asked you (their Royal Programmer) to compute what shape would get best maximum enclosed-area/wall-length ratio.


You have done some preliminary calculations on a sheet of paper.
For a 2000 meter wall enclosing the 250 000m2 area the
enclosed-area/wall-length ratio is 125.
Although not allowed , but to get an idea if this is anything better:  if you place a circle inside the square area touching the four sides the area will be equal to π×2502 m2 and the perimeter will be π×500 m, so the enclosed-area/wall-length ratio will also be 125.


However, if you cut off from the square four triangles with sides 75 m, 75 m and 752m the total area becomes 238750 m2 and the perimeter becomes 1400+3002m. So this gives an enclosed-area/wall-length ratio of 130.87, which is significantly better.



Find the maximum enclosed-area/wall-length ratio.

315,Digital Root Clocks,Problem 315,"

Sam and Max are asked to transform two digital clocks into two ""digital root"" clocks.
A digital root clock is a digital clock that calculates digital roots step by step.
When a clock is fed a number, it will show it and then it will start the calculation, showing all the intermediate values until it gets to the result.
For example, if the clock is fed the number 137, it will show: ""137"" → ""11"" → ""2"" and then it will go black, waiting for the next number.
Every digital number consists of some light segments: three horizontal (top, middle, bottom) and four vertical (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).
Number ""1"" is made of vertical top-right and bottom-right, number ""4"" is made by middle horizontal and vertical top-left, top-right and bottom-right. Number ""8"" lights them all.
The clocks consume energy only when segments are turned on/off.
To turn on a ""2"" will cost 5 transitions, while a ""7"" will cost only 4 transitions.
Sam and Max built two different clocks.
Sam's clock is fed e.g. number 137: the clock shows ""137"", then the panel is turned off, then the next number (""11"") is turned on, then the panel is turned off again and finally the last number (""2"") is turned on and, after some time, off.
For the example, with number 137, Sam's clock requires:""137""
:
(2 + 5 + 4) × 2 = 22 transitions (""137"" on/off).
""11""
:
(2 + 2) × 2 = 8 transitions (""11"" on/off).
""2""
:
(5) × 2 = 10 transitions (""2"" on/off).

For a grand total of 40 transitions.

Max's clock works differently. Instead of turning off the whole panel, it is smart enough to turn off only those segments that won't be needed for the next number.
For number 137, Max's clock requires:""137""
:
2 + 5 + 4 = 11 transitions (""137"" on)
7 transitions (to turn off the segments that are not needed for number ""11"").
""11""
:
0 transitions (number ""11"" is already turned on correctly)
3 transitions (to turn off the first ""1"" and the bottom part of the second ""1""; 
the top part is common with number ""2"").
""2""
:
4 transitions (to turn on the remaining segments in order to get a ""2"")
5 transitions (to turn off number ""2"").

For a grand total of 30 transitions.

Of course, Max's clock consumes less power than Sam's one.
The two clocks are fed all the prime numbers between A = 107 and B = 2×107. 
Find the difference between the total number of transitions needed by Sam's clock and that needed by Max's one.

325,Stone Game II,Problem 325,"
A game is played with two piles of stones and two players.
On each player's turn, the player may remove a number of stones from the larger pile.
The number of stones removed must be a positive multiple of the number of stones in the smaller pile.
E.g. Let the ordered pair (6,14) describe a configuration with 6 stones in the smaller pile and 14 stones in the larger pile, then the first player can remove 6 or 12 stones from the larger pile.
The player taking all the stones from a pile wins the game.
A winning configuration is one where the first player can force a win. For example, (1,5), (2,6), and (3,12) are winning configurations because the first player can immediately remove all stones in the second pile.
A losing configuration is one where the second player can force a win, no matter what the first player does. For example, (2,3) and (3,4) are losing configurations: any legal move leaves a winning configuration for the second player.
Define S(N) as the sum of (xi+yi) for all losing configurations (xi,yi),0<xi<yi≤N.
We can verify that S(10)=211 and S(104)=230312207313.

327,Rooms of Doom,Problem 327,"
A series of three rooms are connected to each other by automatic doors.

Each door is operated by a security card. Once you enter a room the door automatically closes and that security card cannot be used again. A machine at the start will dispense an unlimited number of cards, but each room (including the starting room) contains scanners and if they detect that you are holding more than three security cards or if they detect an unattended security card on the floor, then all the doors will become permanently locked. However, each room contains a box where you may safely store any number of security cards for use at a later stage.
If you simply tried to travel through the rooms one at a time then as you entered room 3 you would have used all three cards and would be trapped in that room forever!
However, if you make use of the storage boxes, then escape is possible. For example, you could enter room 1 using your first card, place one card in the storage box, and use your third card to exit the room back to the start. Then after collecting three more cards from the dispensing machine you could use one to enter room 1 and collect the card you placed in the box a moment ago. You now have three cards again and will be able to travel through the remaining three doors. This method allows you to travel through all three rooms using six security cards in total.

328,Lowest-cost Search,Problem 328,"
We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers {1,2,…,n} by asking questions. 
Each number (question) we ask, has a cost equal to the number asked and we get one of three possible answers: ""Your guess is lower than the hidden number"", or
 ""Yes, that's it!"", or
 ""Your guess is higher than the hidden number"".
Given the value of n, an optimal strategy minimizes the total cost (i.e. the sum of all the questions asked) for the worst possible case. E.g.
If n=3, the best we can do is obviously to ask the number ""2"". The answer will immediately lead us to find the hidden number (at a total cost =2).
If n=8, we might decide to use a ""binary search"" type of strategy: Our first question would be ""4"" and if the hidden number is higher than 4 we will need one or two additional questions.
Let our second question be ""6"". If the hidden number is still higher than 6, we will need a third question in order to discriminate between 7 and 8.
Thus, our third question will be ""7"" and the total cost for this worst-case scenario will be 4+6+7=17.
We can improve considerably the worst-case cost for n=8, by asking ""5"" as our first question.
If we are told that the hidden number is higher than 5, our second question will be ""7"", then we'll know for certain what the hidden number is (for a total cost of 5+7=12).
If we are told that the hidden number is lower than 5, our second question will be ""3"" and if the hidden number is lower than 3 our third question will be ""1"", giving a total cost of 5+3+1=9.
Since 12>9, the worst-case cost for this strategy is 12. That's better than what we achieved previously with the ""binary search"" strategy; it is also better than or equal to any other strategy.
So, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for n=8.
Let C(n) be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for n, as described above.
Thus C(1)=0, C(2)=1, C(3)=2 and C(8)=12.

In Plato's heaven, there exist an infinite number of bowls in a straight line.
Each bowl either contains some or none of a finite number of beans.
A child plays a game, which allows only one kind of move: removing two beans from any bowl, and putting one in each of the two adjacent bowls. The game ends when each bowl contains either one or no beans.
For example, consider two adjacent bowls containing 2 and 3 beans respectively, all other bowls being empty. The following eight moves will finish the game:

336,Maximix Arrangements,Problem 336,"
A train is used to transport four carriages in the order: ABCD. However, sometimes when the train arrives to collect the carriages they are not in the correct order. 
To rearrange the carriages they are all shunted on to a large rotating turntable. After the carriages are uncoupled at a specific point the train moves off the turntable pulling the carriages still attached with it. The remaining carriages are rotated 180 degrees. All of the carriages are then rejoined and this process is repeated as often as necessary in order to obtain the least number of uses of the turntable.
Some arrangements, such as ADCB, can be solved easily: the carriages are separated between A and D, and after DCB are rotated the correct order has been achieved.
However, Simple Simon, the train driver, is not known for his efficiency, so he always solves the problem by initially getting carriage A in the correct place, then carriage B, and so on.
Using four carriages, the worst possible arrangements for Simon, which we shall call maximix arrangements, are DACB and DBAC; each requiring him five rotations (although, using the most efficient approach, they could be solved using just three rotations). The process he uses for DACB is shown below.

It can be verified that there are 24 maximix arrangements for six carriages, of which the tenth lexicographic maximix arrangement is DFAECB.

On a strip of squares a number of coins are placed, at most one coin per square. Only one coin, called the silver dollar, has any value. Two players take turns making moves. At each turn a player must make either a regular or a special move.
A regular move consists of selecting one coin and moving it one or more squares to the left. The coin cannot move out of the strip or jump on or over another coin.
Alternatively, the player can choose to make the special move of pocketing the leftmost coin rather than making a regular move. If no regular moves are possible, the player is forced to pocket the leftmost coin.
The winner is the player who pockets the silver dollar.

352,Blood Tests,Problem 352,"

Each one of the 25 sheep in a flock must be tested for a rare virus, known to affect 2% of the sheep population.
An accurate and extremely sensitive PCR test exists for blood samples, producing a clear positive / negative result, but it is very time-consuming and expensive.


Because of the high cost, the vet-in-charge suggests that instead of performing 25 separate tests, the following procedure can be used instead:
The sheep are split into 5 groups of 5 sheep in each group. 
For each group, the 5 samples are mixed together and a single test is performed. Then,
If the result is negative, all the sheep in that group are deemed to be virus-free.
If the result is positive, 5 additional tests will be performed (a separate test for each animal) to determine the affected individual(s).

Since the probability of infection for any specific animal is only 0.02, the first test (on the pooled samples) for each group will be:
Negative (and no more tests needed) with probability 0.985=0.9039207968.
Positive (5 additional tests needed) with probability 1−0.9039207968=0.0960792032.

Thus, the expected number of tests for each group is 1+0.0960792032×5=1.480396016.
Consequently, all 5 groups can be screened using an average of only 1.480396016×5=7.40198008 tests, which represents a huge saving of more than 70%!


Although the scheme we have just described seems to be very efficient, it can still be improved considerably (always assuming that the test is sufficiently sensitive and that there are no adverse effects caused by mixing different samples). E.g.:
We may start by running a test on a mixture of all the 25 samples. It can be verified that in about 60.35% of the cases this test will be negative, thus no more tests will be needed. Further testing will only be required for the remaining 39.65% of the cases.
If we know that at least one animal in a group of 5 is infected and the first 4 individual tests come out negative, there is no need to run a test on the fifth animal (we know that it must be infected).
We can try a different number of groups / different number of animals in each group, adjusting those numbers at each level so that the total expected number of tests will be minimised.

To simplify the very wide range of possibilities, there is one restriction we place when devising the most cost-efficient testing scheme: whenever we start with a mixed sample, all the sheep contributing to that sample must be fully screened (i.e. a verdict of infected / virus-free must be reached for all of them) before we start examining any other animals.

For the current example, it turns out that the most cost-efficient testing scheme (we'll call it the optimal strategy) requires an average of just 4.155452 tests!



Using the optimal strategy, let T(s,p) represent the average number of tests needed to screen a flock of s sheep for a virus having probability p to be present in any individual.
Thus, rounded to six decimal places, T(25,0.02)=4.155452 and T(25,0.10)=12.702124.

Bozo sort, not to be confused with the slightly less efficient bogo sort, consists out of checking if the input sequence is sorted and if not swapping randomly two elements. This is repeated until eventually the sequence is sorted.


If we consider all permutations of the first 4 natural numbers as input the expectation value of the number of swaps, averaged over all 4! input sequences is 24.75.
The already sorted sequence takes 0 steps. 


In this problem we consider the following variant on bozo sort.
If the sequence is not in order we pick three elements at random and shuffle these three elements randomly.
All 3!=6 permutations of those three elements are equally likely. 
The already sorted sequence will take 0 steps.
If we consider all permutations of the first 4 natural numbers as input the expectation value of the number of shuffles, averaged over all 4! input sequences is 27.5. 
Consider as input sequences the permutations of the first 11 natural numbers.

368,A Kempner-like Series,Problem 368,"
The harmonic series 1+12+13+14+⋯ is well known to be divergent.
If we however omit from this series every term where the denominator has a 9 in it, the series remarkably enough converges to approximately 22.9206766193.
This modified harmonic series is called the Kempner series.
Let us now consider another modified harmonic series by omitting from the harmonic series every term where the denominator has 3 or more equal consecutive digits.
One can verify that out of the first 1200 terms of the harmonic series, only 20 terms will be omitted.
These 20 omitted terms are:

For a given n, consider triangles T such that:
- the vertices of T have integer coordinates with absolute value ≤n, and 
- the foci1 of the largest-area ellipse inside T are (13,0) and (−13,0).
Let A(n) be the sum of the areas of all such triangles.


For example, if n=8, there are two such triangles. Their vertices are (−4,−3),(−4,3),(8,0) and (4,3),(4,−3),(−8,0), and the area of each triangle is 36. Thus A(8)=36+36=72.

395,Pythagorean Tree,Problem 395,"

The Pythagorean tree is a fractal generated by the following procedure:


Start with a unit square. Then, calling one of the sides its base (in the animation, the bottom side is the base):
 Attach a right triangle to the side opposite the base, with the hypotenuse coinciding with that side and with the sides in a 3-4-5 ratio. Note that the smaller side of the triangle must be on the 'right' side with respect to the base (see animation).
 Attach a square to each leg of the right triangle, with one of its sides coinciding with that leg.
 Repeat this procedure for both squares, considering as their bases the sides touching the triangle.

The resulting figure, after an infinite number of iterations, is the Pythagorean tree.




It can be shown that there exists at least one rectangle, whose sides are parallel to the largest square of the Pythagorean tree, which encloses the Pythagorean tree completely.


Find the smallest area possible for such a bounding rectangle, and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.

406,Guessing Game,Problem 406,"
We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers {1,2,…,n} by asking questions. 
Each number (question) we ask, we get one of three possible answers: ""Your guess is lower than the hidden number"" (and you incur a cost of a), or
 ""Your guess is higher than the hidden number"" (and you incur a cost of b), or
 ""Yes, that's it!"" (and the game ends).
Given the value of n, a, and b, an optimal strategy minimizes the total cost for the worst possible case.
For example, if n=5, a=2, and b=3, then we may begin by asking ""2"" as our first question.
If we are told that 2 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of b=3), then we are sure that ""1"" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 3).
If we are told that 2 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of a=2), then our next question will be ""4"".
If we are told that 4 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of b=3), then we are sure that ""3"" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+3=5).
If we are told that 4 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of a=2), then we are sure that ""5"" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+2=4).
Thus, the worst-case cost achieved by this strategy is 5. It can also be shown that this is the lowest worst-case cost that can be achieved.

<p>If we are told that 2 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of <var>b</var>=3), then we are sure that ""<b>1</b>"" is the hidden number (for a total cost of <span style=""color:#3333ff;""><b>3</b></span>).<br>
If we are told that 2 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of <var>a</var>=2), then our next question will be ""<b>4</b>"".<br>
If we are told that 4 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of <var>b</var>=3), then we are sure that ""<b>3</b>"" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+3=<span style=""color:#3333ff;""><b>5</b></span>).<br>
If we are told that 4 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of <var>a</var>=2), then we are sure that ""<b>5</b>"" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+2=<span style=""color:#3333ff;""><b>4</b></span>).<br>
Thus, the worst-case cost achieved by this strategy is <span style=""color:#FF0000;""><b>5</b></span>. It can also be shown that this is the lowest worst-case cost that can be achieved.

6174 is a remarkable number; if we sort its digits in increasing order and subtract that number from the number you get when you sort the digits in decreasing order, we get 7641−1467=6174.
Even more remarkable is that if we start from any 4 digit number and repeat this process of sorting and subtracting, we'll eventually end up with 6174 or immediately with 0 if all digits are equal. 
This also works with numbers that have less than 4 digits if we pad the number with leading zeroes until we have 4 digits.
E.g. let's start with the number 0837:
8730−0378=8352
8532−2358=6174


6174 is called the Kaprekar constant. The process of sorting and subtracting and repeating this until either 0 or the Kaprekar constant is reached is called the Kaprekar routine.


We can consider the Kaprekar routine for other bases and number of digits. 
Unfortunately, it is not guaranteed a Kaprekar constant exists in all cases; either the routine can end up in a cycle for some input numbers or the constant the routine arrives at can be different for different input numbers.
However, it can be shown that for 5 digits and a base b=6t+3≠9, a Kaprekar constant exists.
E.g. base 15: (10,4,14,9,5)15
base 21: (14,6,20,13,7)21

Define Cb to be the Kaprekar constant in base b for 5 digits.
Define the function sb(i) to be
0 if i=Cb or if i written in base b consists of 5 identical digits
the number of iterations it takes the Kaprekar routine in base b to arrive at Cb, otherwise

Note that we can define sb(i) for all integers i<b5. If i written in base b takes less than 5 digits, the number is padded with leading zero digits until we have 5 digits before applying the Kaprekar routine.


Define S(b) as the sum of sb(i) for 0<i<b5.

The first character is a numerical digit indicating the size of the information grid. It would be either a 6 (for a 5x5 kakuro puzzle) or a 7 (for a 6x6 puzzle) followed by a comma (,). The extra top line and left column are needed to insert information.
The content of each cell is then described and followed by a comma, going left to right and starting with the top line.
X = Gray cell, not required to be filled by a digit.
O (upper case letter)= White empty cell to be filled by a digit.
A = Or any one of the upper case letters from A to J to be replaced by its equivalent digit in the solved puzzle.
( ) = Location of the encrypted sums. Horizontal sums are preceded by a lower case ""h"" and vertical sums are preceded by a lower case ""v"". Those are followed by one or two upper case letters depending if the sum is a single digit or double digit one. For double digit sums, the first letter would be for the ""tens"" and the second one for the ""units"". When the cell must contain information for both a horizontal and a vertical sum, the first one is always for the horizontal sum and the two are separated by a comma within the same set of brackets, ex.: (hFE,vD). Each set of brackets is also immediately followed by a comma.
The description of the last cell is followed by a Carriage Return/Line Feed (CRLF) instead of a comma.
The required answer to each puzzle is based on the value of each letter necessary to arrive at the solution and according to the alphabetical order. As indicated under the example puzzle, its answer would be 8426039571. At least 9 out of the 10 encrypting letters are always part of the problem description.

A turn consists of moving each ball exactly once according to the following rule: Transfer the leftmost ball which has not been moved to the nearest empty box to its right.


After one turn the sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 2) becomes (2, 2, 1, 2, 3) as can be seen below; note that we begin the new sequence starting at the first occupied box.

431,Square Space Silo,Problem 431,"
Fred the farmer arranges to have a new storage silo installed on his farm and having an obsession for all things square he is absolutely devastated when he discovers that it is circular. Quentin, the representative from the company that installed the silo, explains that they only manufacture cylindrical silos, but he points out that it is resting on a square base. Fred is not amused and insists that it is removed from his property.
Quick thinking Quentin explains that when granular materials are delivered from above a conical slope is formed and the natural angle made with the horizontal is called the angle of repose. For example if the angle of repose, α=30 degrees, and grain is delivered at the centre of the silo then a perfect cone will form towards the top of the cylinder. In the case of this silo, which has a diameter of 6m, the amount of space wasted would be approximately 32.648388556m3. However, if grain is delivered at a point on the top which has a horizontal distance of x metres from the centre then a cone with a strangely curved and sloping base is formed. He shows Fred a picture.


We shall let the amount of space wasted in cubic metres be given by V(x). If x=1.114785284, which happens to have three squared decimal places, then the amount of space wasted, V(1.114785284)≈36. Given the range of possible solutions to this problem there is exactly one other option: V(2.511167869)≈49. It would be like knowing that the square is king of the silo, sitting in splendid glory on top of your grain.
Fred's eyes light up with delight at this elegant resolution, but on closer inspection of Quentin's drawings and calculations his happiness turns to despondency once more. Fred points out to Quentin that it's the radius of the silo that is 6 metres, not the diameter, and the angle of repose for his grain is 40 degrees. However, if Quentin can find a set of solutions for this particular silo then he will be more than happy to keep it.
If Quick thinking Quentin is to satisfy frustratingly fussy Fred the farmer's appetite for all things square then determine the values of x for all possible square space wastage options and calculate ∑x correct to 9 decimal places.

Recall that a graph is a collection of vertices and edges connecting the vertices, and that two vertices connected by an edge are called adjacent.
Graphs can be embedded in Euclidean space by associating each vertex with a point in the Euclidean space.
A flexible graph is an embedding of a graph where it is possible to move one or more vertices continuously so that the distance between at least two nonadjacent vertices is altered while the distances between each pair of adjacent vertices is kept constant.
A rigid graph is an embedding of a graph which is not flexible.
Informally, a graph is rigid if by replacing the vertices with fully rotating hinges and the edges with rods that are unbending and inelastic, no parts of the graph can be moved independently from the rest of the graph.

The grid graphs embedded in the Euclidean plane are not rigid, as the following animation demonstrates:

However, one can make them rigid by adding diagonal edges to the cells. For example, for the 2×3 grid graph, there are 19 ways to make the graph rigid:

Note that for the purposes of this problem, we do not consider changing the orientation of a diagonal edge or adding both diagonal edges to a cell as a different way of making a grid graph rigid.

444,The Roundtable Lottery,Problem 444,"
A group of p people decide to sit down at a round table and play a lottery-ticket trading game. Each person starts off with a randomly-assigned, unscratched lottery ticket. Each ticket, when scratched, reveals a whole-pound prize ranging anywhere from £1 to £p, with no two tickets alike. The goal of the game is for all of the players to maximize the winnings of the ticket they hold upon leaving the game.
An arbitrary person is chosen to be the first player. Going around the table, each player has only one of two options:

The player can choose to scratch the ticket and reveal its worth to everyone at the table.
If the player's ticket is unscratched, then the player may trade it with a previous player's scratched ticket, and then leaves the game with that ticket. The previous player then scratches the newly-acquired ticket and reveals its worth to everyone at the table.

The game ends once all tickets have been scratched. All players still remaining at the table must leave with their currently-held tickets.
Assume that players will use the optimal strategy for maximizing the expected value of their ticket winnings.
Let E(p) represent the expected number of players left at the table when the game ends in a game consisting of p players.
E.g. E(111)=5.2912 when rounded to 5 significant digits.

460,An Ant on the Move,Problem 460,"

On the Euclidean plane, an ant travels from point A(0,1) to point B(d,1) for an integer d.


In each step, the ant at point (x0,y0) chooses one of the lattice points (x1,y1) which satisfy x1≥0 and y1≥1 and goes straight to (x1,y1) at a constant velocity v. The value of v depends on y0 and y1 as follows:
 If y0=y1, the value of v equals y0.
 If y0≠y1, the value of v equals (y1−y0)/(ln⁡(y1)−ln⁡(y0)).

The left image is one of the possible paths for d=4. First the ant goes from A(0,1) to P1(1,3) at velocity (3−1)/(ln⁡(3)−ln⁡(1))≈1.8205. Then the required time is 5/1.8205≈1.2283.
From P1(1,3) to P2(3,3) the ant travels at velocity 3 so the required time is 2/3≈0.6667. From P2(3,3) to B(4,1) the ant travels at velocity (1−3)/(ln⁡(1)−ln⁡(3))≈1.8205 so the required time is 5/1.8205≈1.2283.
Thus the total required time is 1.2283+0.6667+1.2283=3.1233.


The right image is another path. The total required time is calculated as 0.98026+1+0.98026=2.96052. It can be shown that this is the quickest path for d=4.



Let F(d) be the total required time if the ant chooses the quickest path. For example, F(4)≈2.960516287.
We can verify that F(10)≈4.668187834 and F(100)≈9.217221972.

On the Euclidean plane, an ant travels from point $A(0, 1)$ to point $B(d, 1)$ for an integer $d$.

465,Polar Polygons,Problem 465,"
The kernel of a polygon is defined by the set of points from which the entire polygon's boundary is visible. We define a polar polygon as a polygon for which the origin is strictly contained inside its kernel.
For this problem, a polygon can have collinear consecutive vertices. However, a polygon still cannot have self-intersection and cannot have zero area.
For example, only the first of the following is a polar polygon (the kernels of the second, third, and fourth do not strictly contain the origin, and the fifth does not have a kernel at all):

Notice that the first polygon has three consecutive collinear vertices.
Let P(n) be the number of polar polygons such that the vertices (x,y) have integer coordinates whose absolute values are not greater than n.
Note that polygons should be counted as different if they have different set of edges, even if they enclose the same area. For example, the polygon with vertices [(0,0),(0,3),(1,1),(3,0)] is distinct from the polygon with vertices [(0,0),(0,3),(1,1),(3,0),(1,0)].

470,Super Ramvok,Problem 470,"
Consider a single game of Ramvok:
Let t represent the maximum number of turns the game lasts. If t=0, then the game ends immediately. Otherwise, on each turn i, the player rolls a die. After rolling, if i<t the player can either stop the game and receive a prize equal to the value of the current roll, or discard the roll and try again next turn. If i=t, then the roll cannot be discarded and the prize must be accepted. Before the game begins, t is chosen by the player, who must then pay an up-front cost ct for some constant c. For c=0, t can be chosen to be infinite (with an up-front cost of 0). Let R(d,c) be the expected profit (i.e. net gain) that the player receives from a single game of optimally-played Ramvok, given a fair d-sided die and cost constant c. For example, R(4,0.2)=2.65. Assume that the player has sufficient funds for paying any/all up-front costs.
Now consider a game of Super Ramvok:
In Super Ramvok, the game of Ramvok is played repeatedly, but with a slight modification. After each game, the die is altered. The alteration process is as follows: The die is rolled once, and if the resulting face has its pips visible, then that face is altered to be blank instead. If the face is already blank, then it is changed back to its original value. After the alteration is made, another game of Ramvok can begin (and during such a game, at each turn, the die is rolled until a face with a value on it appears). The player knows which faces are blank and which are not at all times. The game of Super Ramvok ends once all faces of the die are blank.
Let S(d,c) be the expected profit that the player receives from an optimally-played game of Super Ramvok, given a fair d-sided die to start (with all sides visible), and cost constant c. For example, S(6,1)=208.3.

478,Mixtures,Problem 478,"
Let us consider mixtures of three substances: A, B and C. A mixture can be described by a ratio of the amounts of A, B, and C in it, i.e., (a:b:c). For example, a mixture described by the ratio (2:3:5) contains 20% A, 30% B and 50% C.
For the purposes of this problem, we cannot separate the individual components from a mixture. However, we can combine different amounts of different mixtures to form mixtures with new ratios.
For example, say we have three mixtures with ratios (3:0:2), (3:6:11) and (3:3:4). By mixing 10 units of the first, 20 units of the second and 30 units of the third, we get a new mixture with ratio (6:5:9), since:
(10⋅35 + 20⋅320+30⋅310:10⋅05+20⋅620+30⋅310:10⋅25+20⋅1120+30⋅410)=(18:15:27)=(6:5:9)

However, with the same three mixtures, it is impossible to form the ratio (3:2:1), since the amount of B is always less than the amount of C.
Let n be a positive integer. Suppose that for every triple of integers (a,b,c) with 0≤a,b,c≤n and gcd(a,b,c)=1, we have a mixture with ratio (a:b:c). Let M(n) be the set of all such mixtures.
For example, M(2) contains the 19 mixtures with the following ratios:
{(0:0:1),(0:1:0),(0:1:1),(0:1:2),(0:2:1),(1:0:0),(1:0:1),(1:0:2),(1:1:0),(1:1:1),(1:1:2),(1:2:0),(1:2:1),(1:2:2),(2:0:1),(2:1:0),(2:1:1),(2:1:2),(2:2:1)}.
Let E(n) be the number of subsets of M(n) which can produce the mixture with ratio (1:1:1), i.e., the mixture with equal parts A, B and C.
We can verify that E(1)=103, E(2)=520447, E(10)mod118=82608406 and E(500)mod118=13801403.
Find E(10000000)mod118.
","<p>Let us consider <b>mixtures</b> of three substances: <b>A</b>, <b>B</b> and <b>C</b>. A mixture can be described by a ratio of the amounts of <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>C</b> in it, i.e., $(a : b : c)$. For example, a mixture described by the ratio $(2 : 3 : 5)$ contains $20\%$ <b>A</b>, $30\%$ <b>B</b> and $50\%$ <b>C</b>.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this problem, we cannot separate the individual components from a mixture. However, we can combine different amounts of different mixtures to form mixtures with new ratios.</p>

<p>For example, say we have three mixtures with ratios $(3 : 0 : 2)$, $(3: 6 : 11)$ and $(3 : 3 : 4)$. By mixing $10$ units of the first, $20$ units of the second and $30$ units of the third, we get a new mixture with ratio $(6 : 5 : 9)$, since:<br>
$(10 \cdot \tfrac 3 5$ + $20 \cdot \tfrac 3 {20} + 30 \cdot \tfrac 3 {10} : 10 \cdot \tfrac 0 5 + 20 \cdot \tfrac 6 {20} + 30 \cdot \tfrac 3 {10} : 10 \cdot \tfrac 2 5 + 20 \cdot \tfrac {11} {20} + 30 \cdot \tfrac 4 {10})
= (18 : 15 : 27) = (6 : 5 : 9)$
</p>

<p>However, with the same three mixtures, it is impossible to form the ratio $(3 : 2 : 1)$, since the amount of <b>B</b> is always less than the amount of <b>C</b>.</p>

<p>Let $n$ be a positive integer. Suppose that for every triple of integers $(a, b, c)$ with $0 \le a, b, c \le n$ and $\gcd(a, b, c) = 1$, we have a mixture with ratio $(a : b : c)$. Let $M(n)$ be the set of all such mixtures.</p>

<p>For example, $M(2)$ contains the $19$ mixtures with the following ratios:</p>
\begin{align}

481,Chef Showdown,Problem 481,"
A group of chefs (numbered #1, #2, etc) participate in a turn-based strategic cooking competition. On each chef's turn, he/she cooks up a dish to the best of his/her ability and gives it to a separate panel of judges for taste-testing. Let S(k) represent chef #k's skill level (which is publicly known). More specifically, S(k) is the probability that chef #k's dish will be assessed favorably by the judges (on any/all turns). If the dish receives a favorable rating, then the chef must choose one other chef to be eliminated from the competition. The last chef remaining in the competition is the winner.
The game always begins with chef #1, with the turn order iterating sequentially over the rest of the chefs still in play. Then the cycle repeats from the lowest-numbered chef. All chefs aim to optimize their chances of winning within the rules as stated, assuming that the other chefs behave in the same manner. In the event that a chef has more than one equally-optimal elimination choice, assume that the chosen chef is always the one with the next-closest turn.
Define Wn(k) as the probability that chef #k wins in a competition with n chefs. If we have S(1)=0.25, S(2)=0.5, and S(3)=1, then W3(1)=0.29375.
Going forward, we assign S(k)=Fk/Fn+1 over all 1≤k≤n, where Fk is a Fibonacci number: Fk=Fk−1+Fk−2 with base cases F1=F2=1. Then, for example, when considering a competition with n=7 chefs, we have W7(1)=0.08965042, W7(2)=0.20775702, W7(3)=0.15291406, W7(4)=0.14554098, W7(5)=0.15905291, W7(6)=0.10261412, and W7(7)=0.14247050, rounded to 8 decimal places each.

We define a permutation as an operation that rearranges the order of the elements {1,2,3,...,n}.
There are n! such permutations, one of which leaves the elements in their initial order.
For n=3 we have 3!=6 permutations:

P1= keep the initial order
P2= exchange the 1st and 2nd elements
P3= exchange the 1st and 3rd elements
P4= exchange the 2nd and 3rd elements
P5= rotate the elements to the right
P6= rotate the elements to the left

If we select one of these permutations, and we re-apply the same permutation repeatedly, we eventually restore the initial order.For a permutation Pi, let f(Pi) be the number of steps required to restore the initial order by applying the permutation Pi repeatedly.For n=3, we obtain:

f(P1)=1 : (1,2,3)→(1,2,3)

497,Drunken Tower of Hanoi,Problem 497,"
Bob is very familiar with the famous mathematical puzzle/game, ""Tower of Hanoi,"" which consists of three upright rods and disks of different sizes that can slide onto any of the rods. The game begins with a stack of n disks placed on the leftmost rod in descending order by size. The objective of the game is to move all of the disks from the leftmost rod to the rightmost rod, given the following restrictions:
Only one disk can be moved at a time.
A valid move consists of taking the top disk from one stack and placing it onto another stack (or an empty rod).
No disk can be placed on top of a smaller disk.
Moving on to a variant of this game, consider a long room k units (square tiles) wide, labeled from 1 to k in ascending order. Three rods are placed at squares a, b, and c, and a stack of n disks is placed on the rod at square a.
Bob begins the game standing at square b. His objective is to play the Tower of Hanoi game by moving all of the disks to the rod at square c. However, Bob can only pick up or set down a disk if he is on the same square as the rod/stack in question.
Unfortunately, Bob is also drunk. On a given move, Bob will either stumble one square to the left or one square to the right with equal probability, unless Bob is at either end of the room, in which case he can only move in one direction. Despite Bob's inebriated state, he is still capable of following the rules of the game itself, as well as choosing when to pick up or put down a disk.
The following animation depicts a side-view of a sample game for n=3, k=7, a=2, b=4, and c=6:

Let E(n,k,a,b,c) be the expected number of squares that Bob travels during a single optimally-played game. A game is played optimally if the number of disk-pickups is minimized.
Interestingly enough, the result is always an integer. For example, E(2,5,1,3,5)=60 and E(3,20,4,9,17)=2358.

503,Compromise or Persist,Problem 503,"
Alice is playing a game with n cards numbered 1 to n.
A game consists of iterations of the following steps.
(1) Alice picks one of the cards at random.
(2) Alice cannot see the number on it. Instead, Bob, one of her friends, sees the number and tells Alice how many previously-seen numbers are bigger than the number which he is seeing.
(3) Alice can end or continue the game. If she decides to end, the number becomes her score. If she decides to continue, the card is removed from the game and she returns to (1). If there is no card left, she is forced to end the game.
Let F(n) be Alice's expected score if she takes the optimized strategy to minimize her score.
For example, F(3)=5/3. At the first iteration, she should continue the game. At the second iteration, she should end the game if Bob says that one previously-seen number is bigger than the number which he is seeing, otherwise she should continue the game.
We can also verify that F(4)=15/8 and F(10)≈2.5579365079.
Find F(106). Give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places behind the decimal point.

So if a pile contains one stone they can't take the last stone from it as 1 isn't a proper divisor of 1.
The first player that can't make a valid move loses the game.
Of course both Anton and Bertrand play optimally.

522,Hilbert's Blackout,Problem 522,"
Despite the popularity of Hilbert's infinite hotel, Hilbert decided to try managing extremely large finite hotels, instead.
To cut costs, Hilbert wished to power the new hotel with his own special generator. Each floor would send power to the floor above it, with the top floor sending power back down to the bottom floor. That way, Hilbert could have the generator placed on any given floor (as he likes having the option) and have electricity flow freely throughout the entire hotel.
Unfortunately, the contractors misinterpreted the schematics when they built the hotel. They informed Hilbert that each floor sends power to another floor at random, instead. This may compromise Hilbert's freedom to have the generator placed anywhere, since blackouts could occur on certain floors.
For example, consider a sample flow diagram for a three-story hotel:

If the generator were placed on the first floor, then every floor would receive power. But if it were placed on the second or third floors instead, then there would be a blackout on the first floor. Note that while a given floor can receive power from many other floors at once, it can only send power to one other floor.
To resolve the blackout concerns, Hilbert decided to have a minimal number of floors rewired. To rewire a floor is to change the floor it sends power to. In the sample diagram above, all possible blackouts can be avoided by rewiring the second floor to send power to the first floor instead of the third floor.
Let F(n) be the sum of the minimum number of floor rewirings needed over all possible power-flow arrangements in a hotel of n floors. For example, F(3)=6, F(8)=16276736, and F(100)mod135707531=84326147.

527,Randomized Binary Search,Problem 527,"
A secret integer t is selected at random within the range 1≤t≤n. 
The goal is to guess the value of t by making repeated guesses, via integer g. After a guess is made, there are three possible outcomes, in which it will be revealed that either g<t, g=t, or g>t. Then the process can repeat as necessary.
Normally, the number of guesses required on average can be minimized with a binary search: Given a lower bound L and upper bound H (initialized to L=1 and H=n), let g=⌊(L+H)/2⌋ where ⌊⋅⌋ is the integer floor function. If g=t, the process ends. Otherwise, if g<t, set L=g+1, but if g>t instead, set H=g−1. After setting the new bounds, the search process repeats, and ultimately ends once t is found. Even if t can be deduced without searching, assume that a search will be required anyway to confirm the value.
Your friend Bob believes that the standard binary search is not that much better than his randomized variant: Instead of setting g=⌊(L+H)/2⌋, simply let g be a random integer between L and H, inclusive. The rest of the algorithm is the same as the standard binary search. This new search routine will be referred to as a random binary search.
Given that 1≤t≤n for random t, let B(n) be the expected number of guesses needed to find t using the standard binary search, and let R(n) be the expected number of guesses needed to find t using the random binary search. For example, B(6)=2.33333333 and R(6)=2.71666667 when rounded to 8 decimal places.

532,Nanobots on Geodesics,Problem 532,"
Bob is a manufacturer of nanobots and wants to impress his customers by giving them a ball coloured by his new nanobots as a present.
His nanobots can be programmed to select and locate exactly one other bot precisely and, after activation, move towards this bot along the shortest possible path and draw a coloured line onto the surface while moving. Placed on a plane, the bots will start to move towards their selected bots in a straight line. In contrast, being placed on a ball, they will start to move along a geodesic as the shortest possible path. However, in both cases, whenever their target moves they will adjust their direction instantaneously to the new shortest possible path. All bots will move at the same speed after their simultaneous activation until each bot reaches its goal.
Now Bob places n bots on the ball (with radius 1) equidistantly on a small circle with radius 0.999 and programs each of them to move toward the next nanobot sitting counterclockwise on that small circle. After activation, the bots move in a sort of spiral until they finally meet at one point on the ball.
Using three bots, Bob finds that every bot will draw a line of length 2.84, resulting in a total length of 8.52 for all three bots, each time rounded to two decimal places. The coloured ball looks like this:

In order to show off a little with his presents, Bob decides to use just enough bots to make sure that the line each bot draws is longer than 1000. What is the total length of all lines drawn with this number of bots, rounded to two decimal places?

We can generalize this definition by abstracting away the constants into new variables:

556,Squarefree Gaussian Integers,Problem 556,"
A Gaussian integer is a number z=a+bi where a, b are integers and i2=−1.
Gaussian integers are a subset of the complex numbers, and the integers are the subset of Gaussian integers for which b=0.
A Gaussian integer unit is one for which a2+b2=1, i.e. one of 1,i,−1,−i.
Let's define a proper Gaussian integer as one for which a>0 and b≥0.
A Gaussian integer z1=a1+b1i is said to be divisible by z2=a2+b2i if z3=a3+b3i=z1/z2 is a Gaussian integer.
z1z2=a1+b1ia2+b2i=(a1+b1i)(a2−b2i)(a2+b2i)(a2−b2i)=a1a2+b1b2a22+b22+a2b1−a1b2a22+b22i=a3+b3i
So, z1 is divisible by z2 if a1a2+b1b2a22+b22 and a2b1−a1b2a22+b22 are integers.
For example, 2 is divisible by 1+i because 2/(1+i)=1−i is a Gaussian integer.
A Gaussian prime is a Gaussian integer that is divisible only by a unit, itself or itself times a unit.
For example, 1+2i is a Gaussian prime, because it is only divisible by 1, i, −1, −i, 1+2i, i(1+2i)=i−2, −(1+2i)=−1−2i and −i(1+2i)=2−i.
2 is not a Gaussian prime as it is divisible by 1+i.
A Gaussian integer can be uniquely factored as the product of a unit and proper Gaussian primes.
For example 2=−i(1+i)2 and 1+3i=(1+i)(2+i).
A Gaussian integer is said to be squarefree if its prime factorization does not contain repeated proper Gaussian primes.
So 2 is not squarefree over the Gaussian integers, but 1+3i is.
Units and Gaussian primes are squarefree by definition.
Let f(n) be the count of proper squarefree Gaussian integers with a2+b2≤n.
For example f(10)=7 because 1, 1+i, 1+2i, 1+3i=(1+i)(2+i), 2+i, 3 and 3+i=−i(1+i)(1+2i) are squarefree, while 2=−i(1+i)2 and 2+2i=−i(1+i)3 are not.
You are given f(102)=54, f(104)=5218 and f(108)=52126906.
Find f(1014).

<p>A Gaussian integer <strong>unit</strong> is one for which $a^2 + b^2 = 1$, i.e. one of $1, i, -1, -i$.<br>
Let's define a <dfn>proper</dfn> Gaussian integer as one for which $a \gt 0$ and $b \ge 0$.</p>

<p>A Gaussian integer $z_1 = a_1 + b_1 i$ is said to be divisible by $z_2 = a_2 + b_2 i$ if $z_3 = a_3 + b_3 i = z_1 / z_2$ is a Gaussian integer.<br>
$\frac {z_1} {z_2} = \frac {a_1 + b_1 i} {a_2 + b_2 i} = \frac {(a_1 + b_1 i)(a_2 - b_2 i)} {(a_2 + b_2 i)(a_2 - b_2 i)} = \frac {a_1 a_2 + b_1 b_2} {a_2^2 + b_2^2} + \frac  {a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2}  {a_2^2 + b_2^2}i = a_3 + b_3 i$<br>
So, $z_1$ is divisible by $z_2$ if $\frac {a_1 a_2 + b_1 b_2} {a_2^2 + b_2^2}$ and $\frac  {a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2}  {a_2^2 + b_2^2}$ are integers.<br>

<p>A <strong>Gaussian prime</strong> is a Gaussian integer that is divisible only by a unit, itself or itself times a unit.<br>
For example, $1 + 2i$ is a Gaussian prime, because it is only divisible by $1$, $i$, $-1$, $-i$, $1 + 2i$, $i(1 + 2i) = i - 2$, $-(1 + 2i) = -1 - 2i$ and $-i(1 + 2i) = 2 - i$.<br>
$2$ is not a Gaussian prime as it is divisible by $1 + i$.</p>

<p>A Gaussian integer can be uniquely factored as the product of a unit and proper Gaussian primes.<br>
For example $2 = -i(1 + i)^2$ and $1 + 3i = (1 + i)(2 + i)$.<br>

So $2$ is not squarefree over the Gaussian integers, but $1 + 3i$ is.<br>

557,Cutting Triangles,Problem 557,"

A triangle is cut into four pieces by two straight lines, each starting at one vertex and ending on the opposite edge. This results in forming three smaller triangular pieces, and one quadrilateral.  If the original triangle has an integral area, it is often possible to choose cuts such that all of the four pieces also have integral area.  For example, the diagram below shows a triangle of area 55 that has been cut in this way.



Representing the areas as a,b,c and d, in the example above, the individual areas are a=22, b=8, c=11 and d=14.  It is also possible to cut a triangle of area 55 such that a=20, b=2, c=24, d=9.

The two solutions described above are (22,8,11,14) and (20,2,24,9).  These are the only two possible quadruples that have a total area of 55.

563,Robot Welders,Problem 563,"
A company specialises in producing large rectangular metal sheets, starting from unit square metal plates.  The welding is performed by a range of robots of increasing size.  Unfortunately, the programming options of these robots are rather limited.  Each one can only process up to 25 identical rectangles of metal, which they can weld along either edge to produce a larger rectangle.  The only programmable variables are the number of rectangles to be processed (up to and including 25), and whether to weld the long or short edge.
For example, the first robot could be programmed to weld together 11 raw unit square plates to make a 11×1 strip. The next could take 10 of these 11×1 strips, and weld them either to make a longer 110×1 strip, or a 11×10 rectangle. Many, but not all, possible dimensions of  metal sheets can be constructed in this way.
One regular customer has a particularly unusual order: The finished product should have an exact area, and the long side must not be more than 10% larger than the short side. If these requirements can be met in more than one way, in terms of the exact dimensions of the two sides, then the customer will demand that all variants be produced. For example, if the order calls for a metal sheet of area 889200, then there are three final dimensions that can be produced: 900×988, 912×975 and 936×950. The target area of 889200 is the smallest area which can be manufactured in three different variants, within the limitations of the robot welders.
Let M(n) be the minimal area that can be manufactured in exactly n variants with the longer edge not greater than 10% bigger than the shorter edge. Hence M(3)=889200.

A line segment of length 2n−3 is randomly split into n segments of integer length (n≥3). In the sequence given by this split, the segments are then used as consecutive sides of a convex n-polygon, formed in such a way that its area is maximal.  All of the (2n−4n−1) possibilities for splitting up the initial line segment occur with the same probability. 
Let E(n) be the expected value of the area that is obtained by this procedure.
For example, for n=3 the only possible split of the line segment of length 3 results in three line segments with length 1, that form an equilateral triangle with an area of 143. Therefore E(3)=0.433013, rounded to 6 decimal places.
For n=4 you can find 4 different possible splits, each of which is composed of three line segments with length 1 and one line segment with length 2. All of these splits lead to the same maximal quadrilateral with an area of 343, thus E(4)=1.299038, rounded to 6 decimal places.

He cuts a piece forming a circular sector of 60 degrees and flips the piece upside down, with the icing on the bottom.
He then rotates the cake by 60 degrees counterclockwise, cuts an adjacent 60 degree piece and flips it upside down.
He keeps repeating this, until after a total of twelve steps, all the icing is back on top.
Amazingly, this works for any piece size, even if the cutting angle is an irrational number: all the icing will be back on top after a finite number of steps.

The second has size y and he flips it. The third has size z and he flips it.

While discussing with his friend Jerry how to use his generator, they invent two different games, they call the reciprocal games:
Both games consist of n turns. Each turn is started by choosing a number k randomly between (and including) 1 and n, with equal probability of 1n for each number, while the possible win for that turn is the reciprocal of k, that is 1k.
In game A, Tom activates his random generator once in each turn.

Let q be a prime and A≥B>0 be two integers with the following properties:
 A and B have no prime factor in common, that is gcd(A,B)=1.
 The product AB is divisible by every prime less than q.
It can be shown that, given these conditions, any sum A+B<q2 and any difference 1<A−B<q2 has to be a prime number. Thus you can verify that a number p is prime by showing that either p=A+B<q2 or p=A−B<q2 for some A,B,q fulfilling the conditions listed above.
Let V(p) be the smallest possible value of A in any sum p=A+B and any difference p=A−B, that verifies p being prime. Examples:
V(2)=1, since 2=1+1<22. 
V(37)=22, since 37=22+15=2⋅11+3⋅5<72 is the associated sum with the smallest possible A.
V(151)=165 since 151=165−14=3⋅5⋅11−2⋅7<132 is the associated difference with the smallest possible A. 

Let S(n) be the sum of V(p) for all primes p<n. For example, S(10)=10 and S(200)=7177.

575,Wandering Robots,Problem 575,"
It was quite an ordinary day when a mysterious alien vessel appeared as if from nowhere. After waiting several hours and receiving no response it is decided to send a team to investigate, of which you are included. Upon entering the vessel you are met by a friendly holographic figure, Katharina, who explains the purpose of the vessel, Eulertopia.
She claims that Eulertopia is almost older than time itself. Its mission was to take advantage of a combination of incredible computational power and vast periods of time to discover the answer to life, the universe, and everything. Hence the resident cleaning robot, Leonhard, along with his housekeeping responsibilities, was built with a powerful computational matrix to ponder the meaning of life as he wanders through a massive 1000 by 1000 square grid of rooms. She goes on to explain that the rooms are numbered sequentially from left to right, row by row. So, for example, if Leonhard was wandering around a 5 by 5 grid then the rooms would be numbered in the following way.


Many millenia ago Leonhard reported to Katharina to have found the answer and he is willing to share it with any life form who proves to be worthy of such knowledge.
Katharina further explains that the designers of Leonhard were given instructions to program him with equal probability of remaining in the same room or travelling to an adjacent room. However, it was not clear to them if this meant (i) an equal probability being split equally between remaining in the room and the number of available routes, or, (ii) an equal probability (50%) of remaining in the same room and then the other 50% was to be split equally between the number of available routes.

(i) Probability of remaining related to number of exits
(ii) Fixed 50% probability of remaining

The records indicate that they decided to flip a coin. Heads would mean that the probability of remaining was dynamically related to the number of exits whereas tails would mean that they program Leonhard with a fixed 50% probability of remaining in a particular room. Unfortunately there is no record of the outcome of the coin, so without further information we would need to assume that there is equal probability of either of the choices being implemented.
Katharina suggests it should not be too challenging to determine that the probability of finding him in a square numbered room in a 5 by 5 grid after unfathomable periods of time would be approximately 0.177976190476 [12 d.p.].
In order to prove yourself worthy of visiting the great oracle you must calculate the probability of finding him in a square numbered room in the 1000 by 1000 lair in which he has been wandering.

A long long time ago in a galaxy far far away, the Wimwians, inhabitants of planet WimWi, discovered an unmanned drone that had landed on their planet. On examining the drone, they uncovered a device that sought the answer for the so called ""Birthday Problem"". The description of the problem was as follows:
If people on your planet were to enter a very large room one by one, what will be the expected number of people in the room when you first find 3 people with Birthdays within 1 day from each other.
The description further instructed them to enter the answer into the device and send the drone into space again. Startled by this turn of events, the Wimwians consulted their best mathematicians. Each year on Wimwi has 10 days and the mathematicians assumed equally likely birthdays and ignored leap years (leap years in Wimwi have 11 days), and found 5.78688636 to be the required answer. As such, the Wimwians entered this answer and sent the drone back into space.
After traveling light years away, the drone then landed on planet Joka. The same events ensued except this time, the numbers in the device had changed due to some unknown technical issues. The description read:

With a 100-day year on the planet, the Jokars (inhabitants of Joka) found the answer to be 8.48967364 (rounded to 8 decimal places because the device allowed only 8 places after the decimal point) assuming equally likely birthdays.

585,Nested Square Roots,Problem 585,"
Consider the term x+y+z that is representing a nested square root. x, y and z are positive integers and y and z are not allowed to be perfect squares, so the number below the outer square root is irrational. Still it can be shown that for some combinations of x, y and z the given term can be simplified into a sum and/or difference of simple square roots of integers, actually denesting the square roots in the initial expression. 
Here are some examples of this denesting:
3+2+2=2+1=2+1
8+15+15=5+3
20+96+12=9+6+3−2=3+6+3−2
28+160+108=15+6+5−2
As you can see the integers used in the denested expression may also be perfect squares resulting in further simplification.
Let F(n) be the number of different terms x+y+z, that can be denested into the sum and/or difference of a finite number of square roots, given the additional condition that 0<x≤n. That is,
x+y+z=∑i=1ksiai
with k, x, y, z and all ai being positive integers, all si=±1 and x≤n. Furthermore y and z  are not allowed to be perfect squares.
Nested roots with the same value are not considered different, for example 7+3+27, 7+12+12 and 7+27+3, that can all three be denested into 2+3, would only be counted once.
You are given that F(10)=17, F(15)=46, F(20)=86, F(30)=213 and F(100)=2918 and F(5000)=11134074.

589,Poohsticks Marathon,Problem 589,"

Christopher Robin and Pooh Bear love the game of Poohsticks so much that they invented a new version which allows them to play for longer before one of them wins and they have to go home for tea. The game starts as normal with both dropping a stick simultaneously on the upstream side of a bridge. But rather than the game ending when one of the sticks emerges on the downstream side, instead they fish their sticks out of the water, and drop them back in again on the upstream side. The game only ends when one of the sticks emerges from under the bridge ahead of the other one having also 'lapped' the other stick - that is, having made one additional journey under the bridge compared to the other stick.


On a particular day when playing this game, the time taken for a stick to travel under the bridge varies between a minimum of 30 seconds, and a maximum of 60 seconds. The time taken to fish a stick out of the water and drop it back in again on the other side is 5 seconds. The current under the bridge has the unusual property that the sticks' journey time is always an integral number of seconds, and it is equally likely to emerge at any of the possible times between 30 and 60 seconds (inclusive). It turns out that under these circumstances, the expected time for playing a single game is 1036.15 seconds (rounded to 2 decimal places). This time is measured from the point of dropping the sticks for the first time, to the point where the winning stick emerges from under the bridge having lapped the other.


The stream flows at different rates each day, but maintains the property that the journey time in seconds is equally distributed amongst the integers from a minimum, n, to a maximum, m, inclusive. Let the expected time of play in seconds be E(m,n). Hence E(60,30)=1036.15...


Let S(k)=∑m=2k∑n=1m−1E(m,n).


For example S(5)=7722.82 rounded to 2 decimal places.

A deck of cards numbered from 1 to n is shuffled randomly such that each permutation is equally likely.


The cards are to be sorted into ascending order using the following technique:

 Look at the initial sequence of cards.  If it is already sorted, then there is no need for further action.  Otherwise, if any subsequences of cards happen to be in the correct place relative to one another (ascending with no gaps), then those subsequences are fixed by attaching the cards together.  For example, with 7 cards initially in the order 4123756, the cards labelled 1, 2 and 3 would be attached together, as would 5 and 6.


 The cards are 'shuffled' by being thrown into the air, but note that any correctly sequenced cards remain attached, so their orders are maintained.  The cards (or bundles of attached cards) are then picked up randomly.  You should assume that this randomisation is unbiased, despite the fact that some cards are single, and others are grouped together. 


 Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the cards are sorted. 


   Let S(n) be the expected number of shuffles needed to sort the cards. Since the order is checked before the first shuffle, S(1)=0. You are given that S(2)=1, and S(5)=4213/871.

597,Torpids,Problem 597,"
The Torpids are rowing races held annually in Oxford, following some curious rules:


A division consists of n boats (typically 13), placed in order based on past performance.

All boats within a division start at 40 metre intervals along the river, in order with the highest-placed boat starting furthest upstream.

The boats all start rowing simultaneously, upstream, trying to catch the boat in front while avoiding being caught by boats behind.

Each boat continues rowing until either it reaches the finish line or it catches up with (""bumps"") a boat in front.

The finish line is a distance L metres (the course length, in reality about 1800 metres) upstream from the starting position of the lowest-placed boat. (Because of the staggered starting positions, higher-placed boats row a slightly shorter course than lower-placed boats.)

When a ""bump"" occurs, the ""bumping"" boat takes no further part in the race. The ""bumped"" boat must continue, however, and may even be ""bumped"" again by boats that started two or more places behind it.

After the race, boats are assigned new places within the division, based on the bumps that occurred. Specifically, for any boat A that started in a lower place than B, then A will be placed higher than B in the new order if and only if one of the following occurred:
   A bumped B directly 
 A bumped another boat that went on to bump B 
 A bumped another boat, that bumped yet another boat, that bumped B 
 etc NOTE: For the purposes of this problem you may disregard the boats' lengths, and assume that a bump occurs precisely when the two boats draw level. (In reality, a bump is awarded as soon as physical contact is made, which usually occurs when there is much less than a full boat length's overlap.)


Suppose that, in a particular race, each boat Bj rows at a steady speed vj=−logXj metres per second, where the Xj are chosen randomly (with uniform distribution) between 0 and 1, independently from one another. These speeds are relative to the riverbank: you may disregard the flow of the river.


Let p(n,L) be the probability that the new order is an even permutation of the starting order, when there are n boats in the division and L is the course length.


For example, with n=3 and L=160, labelling the boats as A,B,C in starting order with C highest, the different possible outcomes of the race are as follows:

 Bumps occurring 
 New order 
 Permutation 
 Probability 
 none

 C, A, B 
 even 
 4/27 
     A bumps B, then B bumps C     
 C, B, A

 2/27 

Therefore, p(3,160)=4/15+4/27=56/135.


You are also given that p(4,400)=0.5107843137, rounded to 10 digits after the decimal point.

599,Distinct Colourings of a Rubik's Cube,Problem 599,"

The well-known Rubik's Cube puzzle has many fascinating mathematical properties. The 2×2×2 variant has 8 cubelets with a total of 24 visible faces, each with a coloured sticker. Successively turning faces will rearrange the cubelets, although not all arrangements of cubelets are reachable without dismantling the puzzle.


Suppose that we wish to apply new stickers to a 2×2×2 Rubik's cube in a non-standard colouring. Specifically, we have n different colours available (with an unlimited supply of stickers of each colour), and we place one sticker on each of the 24 faces in any arrangement that we please. We are not required to use all the colours, and if desired the same colour may appear in more than one face of a single cubelet.


We say that two such colourings c1,c2 are essentially distinct if a cube coloured according to c1 cannot be made to match a cube coloured according to c2 by performing mechanically possible Rubik's Cube moves.


For example, with two colours available, there are 183 essentially distinct colourings.


How many essentially distinct colourings are there with 10 different colours available?

602,Product of Head Counts,Problem 602,"

Alice enlists the help of some friends to generate a random number, using a single unfair coin. She and her friends sit around a table and, starting with Alice, they take it in turns to toss the coin. Everyone keeps a count of how many heads they obtain individually. The process ends as soon as Alice obtains a Head. At this point, Alice multiplies all her friends' Head counts together to obtain her random number.


As an illustration, suppose Alice is assisted by Bob, Charlie, and Dawn, who are seated round the table in that order, and that they obtain the sequence of Head/Tail outcomes THHH—TTTT—THHT—H beginning and ending with Alice. Then Bob and Charlie each obtain 2 heads, and Dawn obtains 1 head. Alice's random number is therefore 2×2×1=4.


Define e(n,p) to be the expected value of Alice's random number, where n is the number of friends helping (excluding Alice herself), and p is the probability of the coin coming up Tails.


It turns out that, for any fixed n, e(n,p) is always a polynomial in p. For example, e(3,p)=p3+4p2+p.


Define c(n,k) to be the coefficient of pk in the polynomial e(n,p). So c(3,1)=1, c(3,2)=4, and c(3,3)=1.

607,Marsh Crossing,Problem 607,"

Frodo and Sam need to travel 100 leagues due East from point A to point B. On normal terrain, they can cover 10 leagues per day, and so the journey would take 10 days. However, their path is crossed by a long marsh which runs exactly South-West to North-East, and walking through the marsh will slow them down. The marsh is 50 leagues wide at all points, and the mid-point of AB is located in the middle of the marsh. A map of the region is shown in the diagram below:




The marsh consists of 5 distinct regions, each 10 leagues across, as shown by the shading in the map. The strip closest to point A is relatively light marsh, and can be crossed at a speed of 9 leagues per day. However, each strip becomes progressively harder to navigate, the speeds going down to 8, 7, 6 and finally 5 leagues per day for the final region of marsh, before it ends and the terrain becomes easier again, with the speed going back to 10 leagues per day.


If Frodo and Sam were to head directly East for point B, they would travel exactly 100 leagues, and the journey would take approximately 13.4738 days. However, this time can be shortened if they deviate from the direct path.

610,Roman Numerals II,Problem 610,"
A random generator produces a sequence of symbols drawn from the set {I, V, X, L, C, D, M, #}. Each item in the sequence is determined by selecting one of these symbols at random, independently of the other items in the sequence. At each step, the seven letters are equally likely to be selected, with probability 14% each, but the # symbol only has a 2% chance of selection.
We write down the sequence of letters from left to right as they are generated, and we stop at the first occurrence of the # symbol (without writing it). However, we stipulate that what we have written down must always (when non-empty) be a valid Roman numeral representation in minimal form. If appending the next letter would contravene this then we simply skip it and try again with the next symbol generated.
Please take careful note of About... Roman Numerals for the definitive rules for this problem on what constitutes a ""valid Roman numeral representation"" and ""minimal form"". For example, the (only) sequence that represents 49 is XLIX. The subtractive combination IL is invalid because of rule (ii), while XXXXIX is valid but not minimal. The rules do not place any restriction on the number of occurrences of M, so all positive integers have a valid representation. These are the same rules as were used in Problem 89, and members are invited to solve that problem first.
Find the expected value of the number represented by what we have written down when we stop. (If nothing is written down then count that as zero.) Give your answer rounded to 8 places after the decimal point.

Four other distinct circles, which we call ""planets"", with circumferences p, p, q, q centimetres respectively (p<q), are inscribed within C but outside S, with each planet touching both C and S tangentially. The planets are permitted to overlap one another, but the boundaries of S and C must be at least 1cm apart at their closest point.
Now suppose that these circles are actually gears with perfectly meshing teeth at a pitch of 1cm. C is an internal gear with teeth on the inside. We require that c, s, p, q are all integers (as they are the numbers of teeth), and we further stipulate that any gear must have at least 5 teeth.
Note that ""perfectly meshing"" means that as the gears rotate, the ratio between their angular velocities remains constant, and the teeth of one gear perfectly align with the groves of the other gear and vice versa. Only for certain gear sizes and positions will it be possible for S and C each to mesh perfectly with all the planets. Arrangements where not all gears mesh perfectly are not valid.
Define g(c,s,p,q) to be the number of such gear arrangements for given values of c, s, p, q: it turns out that this is finite as only certain discrete arrangements are possible satisfying the above conditions. For example, g(16,5,5,6)=9.

622,Riffle Shuffles,Problem 622,"

A riffle shuffle is executed as follows: a deck of cards is split into two equal halves, with the top half taken in the left hand and the bottom half taken in the right hand. Next, the cards are interleaved exactly, with the top card in the right half inserted just after the top card in the left half, the 2nd card in the right half just after the 2nd card in the left half, etc. (Note that this process preserves the location of the top and bottom card of the deck)


Let s(n) be the minimum number of consecutive riffle shuffles needed to restore a deck of size n to its original configuration, where n is a positive even number.

Amazingly, a standard deck of 52 cards will first return to its original configuration after only 8 perfect shuffles, so s(52)=8. It can be verified that a deck of 86 cards will also return to its original configuration after exactly 8 shuffles, and the sum of all values of n that satisfy s(n)=8 is 412.


Find the sum of all values of n that satisfy s(n)=60.

623,Lambda Count,Problem 623,"
The lambda-calculus is a universal model of computation at the core of functional programming languages. It is based on lambda-terms, a minimal programming language featuring only function definitions, function calls and variables. Lambda-terms are built according to the following rules:

Any variable x (single letter, from some infinite alphabet) is a lambda-term.
If M and N are lambda-terms, then (MN) is a lambda-term, called the application of M to N.
If x is a variable and M is a term, then (λx.M) is a lambda-term, called an abstraction. An abstraction defines an anonymous function, taking x as parameter and sending back M.

A lambda-term T is said to be closed if for all variables x, all occurrences of x within T are contained within some abstraction (λx.M) in T. The smallest such abstraction is said to bind the occurrence of the variable x. In other words, a lambda-term is closed if all its variables are bound to parameters of enclosing functions definitions. For example, the term (λx.x) is closed, while the term (λx.(xy)) is not because y is not bound.
Also, we can rename variables as long as no binding abstraction changes. This means that (λx.x) and (λy.y) should be considered equivalent since we merely renamed a parameter. Two terms equivalent modulo such renaming are called α-equivalent. Note that (λx.(λy.(xy))) and (λx.(λx.(xx))) are not α-equivalent, since the abstraction binding the first variable was the outer one and becomes the inner one. However, (λx.(λy.(xy))) and (λy.(λx.(yx))) are α-equivalent.
The following table regroups the lambda-terms that can be written with at most 15 symbols, symbols being parenthesis, λ, dot and variables.
(λx.x)(λx.(xx))(λx.(λy.x))(λx.(λy.y))(λx.(x(xx)))(λx.((xx)x))(λx.(λy.(xx)))(λx.(λy.(xy)))(λx.(λy.(yx)))(λx.(λy.(yy)))(λx.(x(λy.x)))(λx.(x(λy.y)))(λx.((λy.x)x))(λx.((λy.y)x))((λx.x)(λx.x))(λx.(x(x(xx))))(λx.(x((xx)x)))(λx.((xx)(xx)))(λx.((x(xx))x))(λx.(((xx)x)x))
Let be Λ(n) the number of distinct closed lambda-terms that can be written using at most n symbols, where terms that are α-equivalent to one another should be counted only once. You are given that Λ(6)=1, Λ(9)=2, Λ(15)=20 and Λ(35)=3166438.

633,Square Prime Factors II,Problem 633,"
For an integer n, we define the square prime factors of n to be the primes whose square divides n. For example, the square prime factors of 1500=22×3×53 are 2 and 5.

644,Squares on the Line,Problem 644,"
Sam and Tom are trying a game of (partially) covering a given line segment of length L by taking turns in placing unit squares onto the line segment. 
As illustrated below, the squares may be positioned in two different ways, either ""straight"" by placing the midpoints of two opposite sides on the line segment, or ""diagonal"" by placing two opposite corners on the line segment. Newly placed squares may touch other squares, but are not allowed to overlap any other square laid down before.
The player who is able to place the last unit square onto the line segment wins.




With Sam starting each game by placing the first square, they quickly realise that Sam can easily win every time by placing the first square in the middle of the line segment, making the game boring. 

Therefore they decide to randomise Sam's first move, by first tossing a fair coin to determine whether the square will be placed straight or diagonal onto the line segment and then choosing the actual position on the line segment randomly with all possible positions being equally likely. Sam's gain of the game is defined to be 0 if he loses the game and L if he wins. Assuming optimal play of both players after Sam's initial move, you can see that Sam's expected gain, called e(L), is only dependent on the length of the line segment.

For example, if L=2, Sam will win with a probability of 1, so e(2)=2. 
Choosing L=4, the winning probability will be 0.33333333 for the straight case and 0.22654092 for the diagonal case, leading to e(4)=1.11974851 (rounded to 8 digits after the decimal point each).

Being interested in the optimal value of L for Sam, let's define f(a,b) to be the maximum of e(L) for some L∈[a,b]. 
You are given f(2,10)=2.61969775, being reached for L=7.82842712, and f(10,20)=5.99374121 (rounded to 8 digits each).

Assuming optimal play of both players after Sam's initial move, you can see that Sam's expected gain, called $e(L)$, is only dependent on the length of the line segment.</p>
<p>
For example, if $L=2$, Sam will win with a probability of $1$, so $e(2)= 2$. <br>
Choosing $L=4$, the winning probability will be $0.33333333$ for the straight case and $0.22654092$ for the diagonal case, leading to $e(4)=1.11974851$ (rounded to $8$ digits after the decimal point each).</p>

The game may start with any arrangement of c coins in squares on the board. It is possible at any time for more than one coin to occupy the same square on the board at the same time. The coins are distinguishable, so swapping two coins gives a different arrangement if (and only if) they are on different squares.
On a given turn, the player must choose a coin and move it either left or up 2, 3, 5, or 7 spaces in a single direction. The only restriction is that the coin cannot move off the edge of the board.

653,Frictionless Tube,Problem 653,"
Consider a horizontal frictionless tube with length L millimetres, and a diameter of 20 millimetres. The east end of the tube is open, while the west end is sealed. The tube contains N marbles of diameter 20 millimetres at designated starting locations, each one initially moving either westward or eastward with common speed v.
Since there are marbles moving in opposite directions, there are bound to be some collisions. We assume that the collisions are perfectly elastic, so both marbles involved instantly change direction and continue with speed v away from the collision site. Similarly, if the west-most marble collides with the sealed end of the tube, it instantly changes direction and continues eastward at speed v. On the other hand, once a marble reaches the unsealed east end, it exits the tube and has no further interaction with the remaining marbles.
To obtain the starting positions and initial directions, we use the pseudo-random sequence rj defined by:
r1=6563116
rj+1=rj2mod32745673
The west-most marble is initially positioned with a gap of (r1mod1000)+1 millimetres between it and the sealed end of the tube, measured from the west-most point of the surface of the marble. Then, for 2≤j≤N, counting from the west, the gap between the (j−1)th and jth marbles, as measured from their closest points, is given by (rjmod1000)+1 millimetres.
Furthermore, the jth marble is initially moving eastward if rj≤10000000, and westward if rj>10000000.
For example, with N=3, the sequence specifies gaps of 117, 432, and 173 millimetres. The marbles' centres are therefore 127, 579, and 772 millimetres from the sealed west end of the tube. The west-most marble initially moves eastward, while the other two initially move westward.
Under this setup, and with a five metre tube (L=5000), it turns out that the middle (second) marble travels 5519 millimetres before its centre reaches the east-most end of the tube.
Let d(L,N,j) be the distance in millimetres that the jth marble travels before its centre reaches the eastern end of the tube. So d(5000,3,2)=5519. You are also given that d(10000,11,6)=11780 and d(100000,101,51)=114101.

Two friends A and B are great fans of Chess. They both enjoy playing the game, but after each game the player who lost the game would like to continue (to get back at the other player) and the player who won would prefer to stop (to finish on a high).
So they come up with a plan. After every game, they would toss a (biased) coin with probability p of Heads (and hence probability 1−p of Tails). If they get Tails, they will continue with the next game. Otherwise they end the match. Also, after every game the players make a note of who is leading in the match.
Let pA denote the probability of A winning a game and pB the probability of B winning a game. Accordingly 1−pA−pB is the probability that a game ends in a draw. Let EA(pA,pB,p) denote the expected number of times A was leading in the match.

Each move of the game consists of the following steps:

Choose one token T to move. This may be any token on the board, as long as not all of its four adjacent squares are empty.
Select and discard one token D from a square adjacent to that of T.
Move T to any one of its four adjacent squares (even if that square is already occupied).

666,Polymorphic Bacteria,Problem 666,"
Members of a species of bacteria occur in two different types: α and β. Individual bacteria are capable of multiplying and mutating between the types according to the following rules:
Every minute, each individual will simultaneously undergo some kind of transformation.
Each individual A of type α will, independently, do one of the following (at random with equal probability):
clone itself, resulting in a new bacterium of type α (alongside A who remains)
split into 3 new bacteria of type β (replacing A)

Each individual B of type β will, independently, do one of the following (at random with equal probability):
spawn a new bacterium of type α (alongside B who remains)
die

If a population starts with a single bacterium of type α, then it can be shown that there is a 0.07243802 probability that the population will eventually die out, and a 0.92756198 probability that the population will last forever. These probabilities are given rounded to 8 decimal places.


Now consider another species of bacteria, Sk,m (where k and m are positive integers), which occurs in k different types αi for 0≤i<k. The rules governing this species' lifecycle involve the sequence rn defined by:

r0=306
rn+1=rn2mod10007

Every minute, for each i, each bacterium A of type αi will independently choose an integer j uniformly at random in the range 0≤j<m. What it then does depends on q=rim+jmod5:
If q=0, A dies.
If q=1, A clones itself, resulting in a new bacterium of type αi (alongside A who remains).
If q=2, A mutates, changing into type α(2i)modk.
If q=3, A splits into 3 new bacteria of type α(i2+1)modk (replacing A).
If q=4, A spawns a new bacterium of type α(i+1)modk (alongside A who remains).

In fact, our original species was none other than S2,2, with α=α0 and β=α1.


Let Pk,m be the probability that a population of species Sk,m, starting with a single bacterium of type α0, will eventually die out. So P2,2=0.07243802. You are also given that P4,3=0.18554021 and P10,5=0.53466253, all rounded to 8 decimal places.

669,The King's Banquet,Problem 669,"
The Knights of the Order of Fibonacci are preparing a grand feast for their king. There are n knights, and each knight is assigned a distinct number from 1 to n.
When the knights sit down at the roundtable for their feast, they follow a peculiar seating rule: two knights can only sit next to each other if their respective numbers sum to a Fibonacci number.
When the n knights all try to sit down around a circular table with n chairs, they are unable to find a suitable seating arrangement for any n>2 despite their best efforts. Just when they are about to give up, they remember that the king will sit on his throne at the table as well.
Suppose there are n=7 knights and 7 chairs at the roundtable, in addition to the king’s throne. After some trial and error, they come up with the following seating arrangement (K represents the king):



Notice that the sums 4+1, 1+7, 7+6, 6+2, 2+3, and 3+5 are all Fibonacci numbers, as required. It should also be mentioned that the king always prefers an arrangement where the knight to the his left has a smaller number than the knight to his right. With this additional rule, the above arrangement is unique for n=7, and the knight sitting in the 3rd chair from the king’s left is knight number 7.
Later, several new knights are appointed to the Order, giving 34 knights and chairs in addition to the king's throne. The knights eventually determine that there is a unique seating arrangement for n=34 satisfying the above rules, and this time knight number 30 is sitting in the 3rd chair from the king's left.
Now suppose there are n=99194853094755497 knights and the same number of chairs at the roundtable (not including the king’s throne). After great trials and tribulations, they are finally able to find the unique seating arrangement for this value of n that satisfies the above rules.

673,Beds and Desks,Problem 673,"
At Euler University, each of the n students (numbered from 1 to n) occupies a bed in the dormitory and uses a desk in the classroom.
Some of the beds are in private rooms which a student occupies alone, while the others are in double rooms occupied by two students as roommates. Similarly, each desk is either a single desk for the sole use of one student, or a twin desk at which two students sit together as desk partners.
We represent the bed and desk sharing arrangements each by a list of pairs of student numbers. For example, with n=4, if (2,3) represents the bed pairing and (1,3)(2,4) the desk pairing, then students 2 and 3 are roommates while 1 and 4 have single rooms, and students 1 and 3 are desk partners, as are students 2 and 4.
The new chancellor of the university decides to change the organisation of beds and desks: a permutation σ of the numbers 1,2,…,n will be chosen, and each student k will be given both the bed and the desk formerly occupied by student number σ(k).
The students agree to this change, under the conditions that:

Any two students currently sharing a room will still be roommates.
Any two students currently sharing a desk will still be desk partners.

In the example above, there are only two ways to satisfy these conditions: either take no action (σ is the identity permutation), or reverse the order of the students.
With n=6, for the bed pairing (1,2)(3,4)(5,6) and the desk pairing (3,6)(4,5), there are 8 permutations which satisfy the conditions. One example is the mapping (1,2,3,4,5,6)↦(1,2,5,6,3,4).

then among the 36! possible permutations (including the identity permutation), 663552 of them satisfy the conditions stipulated by the students.

The least simultaneous value of A and B is 23, attained for x=3,y=1,z=t=0. On the other hand, A=C has no solutions in non-negative integers, so the least simultaneous value of A and C is 0. The total sum of least simultaneous pairs made of I-expressions from {A,B,C} is 26.

For example when n=10 and k=3 the piles 2,3,5 is the best that can be done and so f(10,3)=2. It is impossible to divide 10 into 5 non-empty differently-sized piles and hence f(10,5)=0.


Define F(n) to be the sum of f(n,k) for all possible pile sizes k≥1. For example F(100)=275.


Further define S(N)=∑n=1NF(n). You are given S(100)=12656.

690,Tom and Jerry,Problem 690,"

Tom (the cat) and Jerry (the mouse) are playing on a simple graph G.


Every vertex of G is a mousehole, and every edge of G is a tunnel connecting two mouseholes.


Originally, Jerry is hiding in one of the mouseholes.
Every morning, Tom can check one (and only one) of the mouseholes. If Jerry happens to be hiding there then Tom catches Jerry and the game is over.
Every evening, if the game continues, Jerry moves to a mousehole which is adjacent (i.e. connected by a tunnel, if there is one available) to his current hiding place. The next morning Tom checks again and the game continues like this.


Let us call a graph G a Tom graph, if our super-smart Tom, who knows the configuration of the graph but does not know the location of Jerry, can guarantee to catch Jerry in finitely many days.
For example consider all graphs on 3 nodes:





For graphs 1 and 2, Tom will catch Jerry in at most three days. For graph 3 Tom can check the middle connection on two consecutive days and hence guarantee to catch Jerry in at most two days. These three graphs are therefore Tom Graphs. However, graph 4 is not a Tom Graph because the game could potentially continue forever.


Let T(n) be the number of different Tom graphs with n vertices. Two graphs are considered the same if there is a bijection f between their vertices, such that (v,w) is an edge if and only if (f(v),f(w)) is an edge.


We have T(3)=3, T(7)=37, T(10)=328 and T(20)=1416269.

Two positive integers x and y (x>y) can generate a sequence in the following manner:

ax=y is the first term,
az+1=az2modz for z=x,x+1,x+2,… and
the generation stops when a term becomes 0 or 1.

The number of terms in this sequence is denoted l(x,y).

Hence l(5,3)=29.
g(x) is defined  to be the maximum value of l(x,y) for y<x. For example, g(5)=29.

702,Jumping Flea,Problem 702,"
A regular hexagon table of side length N is divided into equilateral triangles of side length 1. The picture below is an illustration of the case N=3.


An flea of negligible size is jumping on this table. The flea starts at the centre of the table. Thereafter, at each step, it chooses one of the six corners of the table, and jumps to the mid-point between its current position and the chosen corner.
For every triangle T, we denote by J(T) the minimum number of jumps required for the flea to reach the interior of T. Landing on an edge or vertex of T is not sufficient.
For example, J(T)=3 for the triangle marked with a star in the picture: by jumping from the centre half way towards F, then towards C, then towards E.
Let S(N) be the sum of J(T) for all the upper-pointing triangles T in the upper half of the table. For the case N=3, these are the triangles painted black in the above picture.

716,Grid Graphs,Problem 716,"

Consider a directed graph made from an orthogonal lattice of H×W nodes. 
The edges are the horizontal and vertical connections between adjacent nodes.
W vertical directed lines are drawn and all the edges on these lines inherit that direction. Similarly, H horizontal directed lines are drawn and all the edges on these lines inherit that direction.


Two nodes, A and B in a directed graph, are strongly connected if there is both a path, along the directed edges, from A to B as well as from B to A. Note that every node is strongly connected to itself.


A strongly connected component in a directed graph is a non-empty set M of nodes satisfying the following two properties:


All nodes in M are strongly connected to each other.
M is maximal, in the sense that no node in M is strongly connected to any node outside of M.


There are 2H×2W ways of drawing the directed lines. Each way gives a directed graph G. We define S(G) to be the number of strongly connected components in G.


The illustration below shows a directed graph with H=3 and W=4 that consists of four different strongly connected components (indicated by the different colours).

The collapsing process happens every time a bottle is taken. A space is created in the stack and that space is filled according to the following recursive steps:

No bottle touching from above: nothing happens. For example, taking F.
One bottle touching from above: that will drop down to fill the space creating another space. For example, taking D.
Two bottles touching from above: one will drop down to fill the space creating another space. For example, taking C.


This process happens recursively; for example, taking bottle A in the diagram above. Its place can be filled with either B or C. If it is filled with C then the space that C creates can be filled with D or E.

Consider a function f(k) defined for all positive integers k>0. Let S be the sum of the first n values of f. That is,
S=f(1)+f(2)+f(3)+⋯+f(n)=∑k=1nf(k).
In this problem, we employ randomness to approximate this sum. That is, we choose a random, uniformly distributed, m-tuple of positive integers (X1,X2,X3,⋯,Xm) such that 0=X0<X1<X2<⋯<Xm≤n and calculate a modified sum S∗ as follows.
S∗=∑i=1mf(Xi)(Xi−Xi−1)
We now define the error of this approximation to be Δ=S−S∗.
Let E(Δ|f(k),n,m) be the expected value of the error given the function f(k), the number of terms n in the sum and the length of random sample m.
For example, E(Δ|k,100,50)=2525/1326≈1.904223 and E(Δ|φ(k),104,102)≈5842.849907, where φ(k) is Euler's totient function.

Initially S and M are full of water and L is empty.
By pouring water between the buckets exactly one litre of water can be measured.
Since there is no other way to measure, once a pouring starts it cannot stop until either the source bucket is empty or the destination bucket is full.

Two friends, a runner and a swimmer, are playing a sporting game: The swimmer is swimming within a circular pool while the runner moves along the pool edge.
While the runner tries to catch the swimmer at the very moment that the swimmer leaves the pool, the swimmer tries to reach the edge before the runner arrives there. They start the game with the swimmer located in the middle of the pool, while the runner is located anywhere at the edge of the pool.
We assume that the swimmer can move with any velocity up to 1 in any direction and the runner can move with any velocity up to v in either direction around the edge of the pool. Moreover we assume that both players can react immediately to any change of movement of their opponent.
Assuming optimal strategy of both players, it can be shown that the swimmer can always win by escaping the pool at some point at the edge before the runner gets there, if v is less than the critical speed VCircle≈4.60333885 and can never win if v>VCircle.

798,Card Stacking Game,Problem 798,"

Two players play a game with a deck of cards which contains s suits with each suit containing n cards numbered from 1 to n.

Before the game starts, a set of cards (which may be empty) is picked from the deck and placed face-up on the table, with no overlap. These are called the visible cards.

The players then make moves in turn.
A move consists of choosing a card X from the rest of the deck and placing it face-up on top of a visible card Y, subject to the following restrictions:

X and Y must be the same suit;
the value of X must be larger than the value of Y.


The card X then covers the card Y and replaces Y as a visible card.
The player unable to make a valid move loses and play stops.

828,Numbers Challenge,Problem 828,"
It is a common recreational problem to make a target number using a selection of other numbers. In this problem you will be given six numbers and a target number.
For example, given the six numbers 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 25, and a target of 211, one possible solution is:
211=(3+6)×25−(4×7)÷2
This uses all six numbers. However, it is not necessary to do so. Another solution that does not use the 7 is:
211=(25−2)×(6+3)+4
Define the score of a solution to be the sum of the numbers used. In the above example problem, the two given solutions have scores 47 and 40 respectively. It turns out that this problem has no solutions with score less than 40.
When combining numbers, the following rules must be observed:

Each available number may be used at most once.
Only the four basic arithmetic operations are permitted: +, −, ×, ÷.
All intermediate values must be positive integers, so for example (3÷2) is never permitted as a subexpression (even if the final answer is an integer).

The attached file number-challenges.txt contains 200 problems, one per line in the format:
211:2,3,4,6,7,25
where the number before the colon is the target and the remaining comma-separated numbers are those available to be used.
Numbering the problems 1, 2, ..., 200, we let sn be the minimum score of the solution to the nth problem. For example, s1=40, as the first problem in the file is the example given above. Note that not all problems have a solution; in such cases we take sn=0.

Amidakuji (Japanese: 阿弥陀籤) is a method for producing a random permutation of a set of objects.

In the beginning, a number of parallel vertical lines are drawn, one for each object. Then a specified number of horizontal rungs are added, each lower than any previous rungs. Each rung is drawn as a line segment spanning a randomly select pair of adjacent vertical lines.

For example, the following diagram depicts an Amidakuji with three objects (A, B, C) and six rungs:




The coloured lines in the diagram illustrate how to form the permutation. For each object, starting from the top of its vertical line, trace downwards but follow any rung encountered along the way, and record which vertical we end up on.

The edges of a regular star polygon intersect one another, dividing the interior into several regions. Define the alternating shading of a regular star polygon to be a selection of such regions to shade, such that every piece of every edge has a shaded region on one side and an unshaded region on the other, with the exterior of the polygon unshaded.

<p>The edges of a regular star polygon intersect one another, dividing the interior into several regions. Define the <dfn>alternating shading</dfn> of a regular star polygon to be a selection of such regions to shade, such that every piece of every edge has a shaded region on one side and an unshaded region on the other, with the exterior of the polygon unshaded. For example, the above image shows the alternating shading (in green) of $\{8/3\}$.</p>

<p>Let $A(p, q)$ be the area of the alternating shading of $\{p/q\}$, assuming that its inradius is $1$. (The <strong>inradius</strong> of a regular polygon, star or otherwise, is the distance from its centre to the midpoint of any of its edges.) For example, in the diagram above, it can be shown that central shaded octagon has area $8(\sqrt{2}-1)$ and each point's shaded kite has area $2(\sqrt{2}-1)$, giving $A(8,3) = 24(\sqrt{2}-1) \approx 9.9411254970$.</p>

Given n equally spaced points on a circle, we define an n-star polygon as an n-gon having those n points as vertices. Two n-star polygons differing by a rotation/reflection are considered different.

For example, there are twelve 5-star polygons shown below.


For an n-star polygon S, let I(S) be the number of its self intersection points.
Let T(n) be the sum of I(S) over all n-star polygons S.

863,Different Dice,Problem 863,"
Using only a six-sided fair dice and a five-sided fair dice, we would like to emulate an n-sided fair dice.
For example, one way to emulate a 28-sided dice is to follow this procedure:

Roll both dice, obtaining integers 1≤p≤6 and 1≤q≤5.
Combine them using r=5(p−1)+q to obtain an integer 1≤r≤30.
If r≤28, return the value r and stop.
Otherwise (r being 29 or 30), roll both dice again, obtaining integers 1≤s≤6 and 1≤t≤5.
Compute u=30(r−29)+5(s−1)+t to obtain an integer 1≤u≤60.
If u>4, return the value ((u−5)mod28)+1 and stop.
Otherwise (with 1≤u≤4), roll the six-sided dice twice, obtaining integers 1≤v≤6 and 1≤w≤6.
Compute x=36(u−1)+6(v−1)+w to obtain an integer 1≤x≤144.
If x>4, return the value ((x−5)mod28)+1 and stop.
Otherwise (with 1≤x≤4), assign u:=x and go back to step 7.

The expected number of dice rolls in following this procedure is 2.142476 (rounded to 6 decimal places). Note that rolling both dice at the same time is still counted as two dice rolls.
There exist other more complex procedures for emulating a 28-sided dice that entail a smaller average number of dice rolls. However, the above procedure has the attractive property that the sequence of dice rolled is predetermined: regardless of the outcome, it follows (D5,D6,D5,D6,D6,D6,D6,...), truncated wherever the process stops. In fact, amongst procedures for n=28 with this restriction, this one is optimal in the sense of minimising the expected number of rolls needed.
Different values of n will in general use different predetermined sequences. For example, for n=8, the sequence (D5,D5,D5,...) gives an optimal procedure, taking 2.083333... dice rolls on average.
Define R(n) to be the expected number of dice rolls for an optimal procedure for emulating an n-sided dice using only a five-sided and a six-sided dice, considering only those procedures where the sequence of dice rolled is predetermined. So, R(8)≈2.083333 and R(28)≈2.142476.

For example, with n=100 the procedure ends in 4 steps:

A round clock only has three hands: hour, minute, second. All hands look identical and move continuously. Moreover, there is no number or reference mark so that the ""upright position"" is unknown. The clock functions the same as a normal 12-hour analogue clock.

Despite the inconvenient design, for most time it is possible to tell the correct time (within a 12-hour cycle) from the clock, just by measuring accurately the angles between the hands. For example, if all three hands coincide, then the time must be 12:00:00.

Nevertheless, there are several moments where the clock shows an ambiguous reading. For example, the following moment could be either 1:30:00 or 7:30:00 (with the clock rotated 180∘). Thus both 1:30:00 and 7:30:00 are ambiguous moments.
Note that even if two hands perfectly coincide, we can still see them as two distinct hands in the same position. Thus for example 3:00:00 and 9:00:00 are not ambiguous moments.

901,Well Drilling,Problem 901,"
A driller drills for water. At each iteration the driller chooses a depth d (a positive real number), drills to this depth and then checks if water was found. If so, the process terminates. Otherwise, a new depth is chosen and a new drilling starts from the ground level in a new location nearby.
Drilling to depth d takes exactly d hours. The groundwater depth is constant in the relevant area and its distribution is known to be an exponential random variable with expected value of 1. In other words, the probability that the groundwater is deeper than d is e−d.
Assuming an optimal strategy, find the minimal expected drilling time in hours required to find water. Give your answer rounded to 9 places after the decimal point.

the rows are non-increasing in size as we move top to bottom;
the columns are non-increasing in size as we move left to right.


Two examples of Young diagrams are shown below.



Two players Right and Down play a game on several Young diagrams, all disconnected from each other. Initially, a token is placed in the top-left square of each diagram. Then they take alternating turns, starting with Right. On Right's turn, Right selects a token on one diagram and moves it any number of squares to the right. On Down's turn, Down selects a token on one diagram and moves it any number of squares downwards. A player unable to make a legal move on their turn loses the game.

For a,b,k≥1 we define an (a,b,k)-staircase to be the Young diagram where the bottom-right frontier consists of k steps of vertical height a and horizontal length b. Shown below are four examples of staircases with (a,b,k) respectively (1,1,4), (5,1,1), (3,3,2), (2,4,3).



Additionally, define the weight of an (a,b,k)-staircase to be a+b+k.

926,Total Roundness,Problem 926,"

A round number is a number that ends with one or more zeros in a given base.

Let us define the roundness of a number n in base b as the number of zeros at the end of the base b representation of n.
For example, 20 has roundness 2 in base 2, because the base 2 representation of 20 is 10100, which ends with 2 zeros.

Also define R(n), the total roundness of a number n, as the sum of the roundness of n in base b for all b>1.
For example, 20 has roundness 2 in base 2 and roundness 1 in base 4, 5, 10, 20, hence we get R(20)=6.

927,Prime-ary Tree,Problem 927,"
A full k-ary tree is a tree with a single root node, such that every node is either a leaf or has exactly k ordered children.  The height of a k-ary tree is the number of edges in the longest path from the root to a leaf.

For instance, there is one full 3-ary tree of height 0, one full 3-ary tree of height 1, and seven full 3-ary trees of height 2. These seven are shown below.


For integers n and k with n≥0 and k≥2, define tk(n) to be the number of full k-ary trees of height n or less. 
Thus, t3(0)=1, t3(1)=2, and t3(2)=9. Also, t2(0)=1, t2(1)=2, and t2(2)=5.

Define Sk to be the set of positive integers m such that m divides tk(n) for some integer n≥0.  For instance, the above values show that 1, 2, and 5 are in S2 and 1, 2, 3, and 9 are in S3.

Let S=⋂pSp where the intersection is taken over all primes p.  Finally, define R(N) to be the sum of all elements of S not exceeding N.  You are given that R(20)=18 and R(1000)=2089.

928,Cribbage,Problem 928,"
This problem is based on (but not identical to) the scoring for the card game 
Cribbage.

Consider a normal pack of 52 cards. A Hand is a selection of one or more of these cards.

For each Hand the Hand score is the sum of the values of the cards in the Hand where the value of Aces is 1 and the value of court cards (Jack, Queen, King) is 10.

The Cribbage score is obtained for a Hand by adding together the scores for:


Pairs. A pair is two cards of the same rank. Every pair is worth 2 points.

Runs. A run is a set of at least 3 cards whose ranks are consecutive, e.g. 9, 10, Jack. Note that Ace is never high, so Queen, King, Ace is not a valid run. The number of points for each run is the size of the run. All locally maximum runs are counted. For example, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 the two runs of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7, 8, 9 are counted but not 2, 3, 4 or 3, 4, 5.

Fifteens. A fifteen is a combination of cards that has value adding to 15. Every fifteen is worth 2 points. For this purpose the value of the cards is the same as in the Hand Score.

For example, (5♠,5♣,5♢,K♡) has a Cribbage score of 14 as there are four ways that fifteen can be made and also three pairs can be made.

The example (A♢,A♡,2♣,3♡,4♣,5♠) has a Cribbage score of 16: two runs of five worth 10 points, two ways of getting fifteen worth 4 points and one pair worth 2 points. In this example the Hand score is equal to the Cribbage score.

Find the number of Hands in a normal pack of cards where the Hand score is equal to the Cribbage score.

Given n≥2 bowls arranged in a circle, m≥2 balls are distributed amongst them.
Initially the balls are distributed randomly: for each ball, a bowl is chosen equiprobably and independently of the other balls. After this is done, we start the following process:

Choose one of the m balls equiprobably at random.
Choose a direction to move - either clockwise or anticlockwise - again equiprobably at random.
Move the chosen ball to the neighbouring bowl in the chosen direction.
Return to step 1.

This process stops when all the m balls are located in the same bowl. Note that this may be after zero steps, if the balls happen to have been initially distributed all in the same bowl.
